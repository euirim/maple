144710,1105196,"U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker Stresses Importance of an Open Internet to Economic Growth, Free Expression in Remarks at the OECD Ministerial Meeting",06/22/16,1,"Good morning. It is great to be here. I want to thank Secretary General Angel Gurria for convening this Ministerial on the Digital Economy. I would also like to thank President Pe√±a Nieto and the Mexican government for hosting us in beautiful Cancun. 

Five years ago, the OECD convened to discuss how governments could best support our growing digital economy. Those discussions culminated in our adoption of the Principles for Internet Policy Making. Together, we recognized that a free, open and secure Internet is the lifeblood of our global digital economy. Together, we committed to protecting the Internet as a platform for innovation, free expression, commerce, and economic opportunity. We embraced those principles -- of openness, of multistakeholder governance, of the free flow of information -- because they embody our shared values and they make people's lives better.  

This Ministerial is an opportunity to ask ourselves, as the representatives of governments and the leaders of nations, if we are living up to those principles. 

We embraced those principles for a reason: The Internet has unleashed opportunity and improved the quality of life for billions of people. Let me tell you about two entrepreneurs joining me at this week's Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Silicon Valley. Hira Batool Rizvi is a young woman from Pakistan who created She-Kab -- a digital service that connects women to drivers who will safely get them to work free of threats and intimidation. And Rachel de Villa is a 23-year old from the Philippines who launched Cropital -- a crowdfunding platform for local farmers to secure scalable financing from investors around the world. The free and open Internet made these stories of innovation and empowerment -- and many more of them -- possible.

As more people around the world gain access to the Internet and join the digital economy, the pace of innovation increases exponentially. Consider this: just a decade ago, less than a fifth of the global population had Internet access.  Today, 3.2 billion people are online. By 2020, five billion people will be. That same year, the emerging ""Internet of Things"" sector will likely comprise a $1.7 trillion global market. By 2025, products and services that rely on cross-border data flows will add $1 trillion annually to the global economy. 

Digital technologies have quickly become a driving force of job creation, entrepreneurship, and innovation in the 21st century.  Yet the digital economy's continued growth is not guaranteed. It depends on our commitment to the revolutionary platform that made it all possible: the free and open Internet.

We must acknowledge that new technologies also bring new challenges -- for businesses, for governments, and for our peoples. Cybersecurity threats are on the rise. Notions of privacy are being upended. Automation is changing the nature of work for our people and disrupting entire industries. For governments, perhaps the greatest challenge of all is responding to these changes in ways that help -- rather than hinder -- the ability of our people to adapt, compete, and succeed in this new world. We believe the OECD principles provide us the best path forward.

Too often, well-intentioned efforts to address legitimate concerns over issues like privacy and security lead to unintended consequences. In recent years we have seen nations rush to throw up digital walls with policies that include: data localization laws that constrict cross-border data flows; content controls that limit access to information; and onerous technical standards that keep foreign competitors out of new markets. This ""digital protectionism"" threatens access to the technologies and information that people want and need to succeed. These policies stifle competition, innovation, free expression. They undermine our vision of a free, open and truly global Internet. We expect such policies from authoritarian regimes that want to isolate their people -- not from nations that welcome the global exchange of ideas and commerce.

Foreign leaders often ask me why the United States is home to the world's most innovative technology companies. The answer of course begins with the ingenuity of the American people -- but it does not end there. Our success in the digital economy is also the result of our approach to Internet policy -- one that mirrors the flexible, multistakeholder system endorsed by the OECD. 

Simply put: when it comes to protecting a free and open Internet, we do not just ""talk the talk."" We ""walk the walk."" And we do so even in the face of complex challenges online. 

To demonstrate our commitment, today the Commerce Department is releasing a new report titled ""Enabling Growth and Innovation in the Digital Economy."" It chronicles our efforts over the past eight years to protect a free and open Internet and grow the digital economy. Today I want to share the ways that OECD principles have informed our policy approaches to strengthening cybersecurity; protecting the free flow of information; and embracing the multistakeholder approach to Internet governance. 

The Commerce Department is committed to stronger stakeholder cooperation on cybersecurity, as endorsed in the OECD principles. When hackers leak personal information, steal intellectual property, or disrupt services, people lose confidence. The digital economy relies on trust, and trust relies on security. 

Neither government nor industry can secure the digital economy alone. We must work together. That is why in 2013, our National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST convened over 3,000 stakeholders from government, industry, and academia to develop voluntary best practices for managing cyber-risk. This effort led to the creation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework -- a widely-praised and voluntary approach for managing cyber risk. According to Gartner, nearly a third of U.S. organizations now use the Framework, including major companies like Bank of America, Boots-Walgreens, and Apple -- demonstrating that the OECD principle of multistakeholder engagement works. 

The OECD principles also recognize that to keep the digital economy growing, data must move freely. Well-meaning regulations can be barriers to cross-border data flows. For example, when companies encounter conflicting approaches to privacy, the risk is that people lose access to critical services and innovative technologies. 

The Commerce Department has worked with the European Commission to bridge the gap between U.S. and European privacy laws. The result is the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. This agreement will support the $260 billion we already trade in digital products and services each year -- and it will encourage future growth. As the E.U. works through the approval process, we are close to implementing a Framework that protects privacy for consumers AND creates certainty for companies. The framework we have created demonstrates how the world's largest economies can address complex issues like data flows and privacy -- and do so while respecting OECD principles.

Our effort to transfer our stewardship role of the Domain Name System to a global multistakeholder community reflects our support for the OECD's principle of multistakeholder governance. For 18 years, ICANN has managed the Domain Name System with great success and with modest oversight by the Commerce Department. The Internet has flourished under ICANN's system of multistakeholder governance, in which industry leaders, public interest groups, and experts provide input and oversight. 

Still, we hear the voices of skeptics. They say the Internet belongs in the hands of government. We could not disagree more. 

The strongest voices for government control often come from countries that censor content and limit access to information. The Internet is the greatest platform for free expression and innovation ever known. Shifting control to an international governmental body would leave the Internet vulnerable to geopolitical disputes and endless bureaucratic delays. It would also chill innovation and slow the expansion of Internet access worldwide -- depriving billions of people access to the currency they need to thrive in the 21st century. We must ensure that the Internet remains accountable not to governments, but to the people, consumers, institutions, and companies who depend on it. Our Administration is committed to this transition.

As manufacturing goes digital, as cars go driverless, as data goes global, our commitment to a free and open Internet has never been more essential. The Internet is the gateway to the global digital economy and the storehouse of human knowledge for people around the world. But in recent years, as more people gain access to the web, we have witnessed an alarming trend towards Internet fragmentation.

That deeply concerns me. It should concern us all. Our ability to empower entrepreneurs, build long-term prosperity, and drive innovation hinges on our collective commitment to a global, free, and open Internet.

When countries build digital walls, when governments control content, when people are left disconnected and disenfranchised, the members of the OECD must stand firm. Together, we must ""walk the walk"" and turn the Principles for Internet Policy Making into action. Together, we must reaffirm our commitment to a free and open Internet that connects people to opportunity around the world.",,,07/07/16 01:45 PM
41567,1105220,Governor McCrory Celebrates Graduation of Marines from Specialized Welding Training Program at Camp Lejeune,06/09/16,1,"Governor Pat McCrory celebrated the graduation of sixteen active-duty Marines from the Veterans in Piping accelerated welding program today at Camp Lejeune. Brigadier General Robert F. Castellvi, Major General (Retired) Matthew Caulfield and Secretary of Military and Veterans Affairs General Cornell Wilson were on hand for the ceremony.

""The Veterans in Piping program builds on our progress to make North Carolina the most military and veteran friendly state in the nation,"" said Governor McCrory. ""Our service men and women have sacrificed so much for our country and it is our goal to help connect them with meaningful careers when they transition into the civilian job market.""

The Veterans in Piping program offers an 18-week intensive training course in welding and other pipe trades to help transitioning active-duty Marines establish successful careers after service.

As part of Governor McCrory's efforts to make North Carolina the most military and veteran friendly state in the nation, he has focused on connecting transitioning military members and veterans to education and jobs. The Governor's statewide veterans hiring initiative, North Carolina for Military Employment (NC4ME), has hosted statewide hiring events and summits which have produced more than 600 private sector job offers for veterans and transitioning military members.  

Governor McCrory cited the NC4ME initiative, the creation of the new Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, and programs like Veterans in Piping for helping North Carolina's unemployment rate among veterans drop 50 percent since he entered office in 2013.",,,07/07/16 02:03 PM
144710,1105231,U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker Delivers Opening Remarks at Final Day of Global Entrepreneurship Summit,06/24/16,1,"Good morning, and welcome to day 3 of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. For those of you who have traveled here from all over the world, I hope you are enjoying Silicon Valley. I grew up in the Palo Alto area and actually earned my law and business degrees right here at Stanford. And I am so proud that we have the opportunity this week to expose all of you to the region's thriving innovation ecosystem and its remarkable network of researchers, entrepreneurs, inventors and investors.

While Silicon Valley is known around the world for its entrepreneurial spirit, innovation can happen anywhere. As Secretary of Commerce, I have traveled all over the United States and to more than 40 countries. And everywhere I go, whether its New Orleans or Accra, Detroit or Kyiv, I have found exceptional entrepreneurs who are taking risks and changing their societies for the better.

The United States -- and the Department of Commerce in particular -- has a unique role to play in ensuring entrepreneurs all over the world have access to the support structure they need to thrive. Indeed, new businesses account for nearly all net new job creation in the United States, creating opportunity for our people and fueling our economy. That is why our Department and this Administration have made it a priority to share our expertise and our experience building an entrepreneurial society with our partners worldwide.

One of the ways we meet this charge is through a public-private partnership called the President's Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship, or PAGE -- which I am honored to chair. PAGE brings together some of America's top entrepreneurs, who use their stories and knowledge to mentor and inspire young people and start-ups, not only across our own country but around the world.

This morning, President Obama signed an executive order that institutionalizes the PAGE program, as well as our country's participation in GES. I am thrilled that PAGE will continue inspiring young people and start-ups into the next Administration and beyond.

Today, you will have the opportunities to hear from several of our PAGE members, including Steve Case from Revolution Growth on how the Internet is transforming entrepreneurship worldwide, Brian Chesky from Airbnb on the sharing economy, Daphne Koller from Coursera on education technology, Julie Hanna from Kiva on immigrant entrepreneurs, Roboticist Helen Greiner on drones and Shark Tank's Daymond John on embracing failure.

You will hear shortly from President Obama -- a man I am proud to call a friend, a leader I am honored to serve as Secretary of Commerce, and a visionary who has made promoting entrepreneurship around the world a signature priority since his first year in office.

I also urge you to use this final day of the summit to reach out to investors through the GES app if you have not already -- because ultimately, this Summit is about more than just promoting the importance of entrepreneurship around the world. I am very proud that my team has been focused on making sure investors attend the summit, so that our entrepreneurs have the opportunity to make key connections. This year, we have almost one investor attending for every two entrepreneurs. Our goal is to give YOU the tools, support, and capital you need to succeed.

Over the next couple days, most of you are going to leave Silicon Valley and return to your home countries. I hope that you leave armed with not only more knowledge to help your businesses succeed, but with ideas for how to work with your own governments to create pro-entrepreneurship policies and programs in your countries. You have had the opportunity to see what works for entrepreneurs from all over the world, so ask the leaders in your country to invest in business incubators that churn out successful companies, push for laws that make it easy for you to both start and close a business, discuss the importance of policies that allow you to fail and get back up again, and promote a culture that encourages risk-taking. Remember: every one of you has the power to be an agent of change and a champion of entrepreneurship.

Finally, I have a personal ask to make of you. Once you are successful, please find a way -- like our PAGE members -- to pay your knowledge forward to the next generation of entrepreneurs; to mentor young people who can benefit from your experience; and to leave the ladder down for those who wish to follow in your path. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of the summit.",,,07/07/16 02:08 PM
27116,1105236,Chairman Goodlatte Statement at Markup of Survivors' Bill of Rights Act,07/07/16,1,"Last month, the harrowing account of the Stanford rape victim sparked outrage across the United States and around the globe. The survivor's letter documented in graphic and painstaking detail the complicated, emotional, and overwhelming process facing victims of sexual assault.  I am going to read a small portion of that letter here. The victim writes:

    ""The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. . . Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. I thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me. 

    ""I shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, I left a little pile in every room I sat in. I was asked to sign papers that said ""Rape Victim' and I thought something has really happened. My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair.""

The letter goes on to describe the rest of the forensic exam, her feelings about what happened to her, and her day in court. What is abundantly clear from this account, which is unfortunately not a unique account, is the trauma and difficulty sexual assault victims face from the moment they are assaulted.

The Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016 makes much needed additions to federal law to give victims of sexual assault additional rights in seeking justice and recovering from their experiences.

These additional rights include the right to not be prevented from accessing a medical forensic exam, the right not to be charged for that exam, and the right to know about the results of that exam. Furthermore, the bill requires that the medical exam be preserved throughout the length of the statute of limitations. Additionally, the bill requires that the government provide notice to the victim when it intends to dispose of the collection kit. I remain deeply troubled at the number of untested rape kits that remain in this country, despite funding by this Committee to address this backlog. Nevertheless, these additional rights related to medical exams will ensure that forensic medical kits will at the very least be preserved for the length of the statute of limitations and victims will have notice so they can contest the destruction of those kits.

This bill also clarifies that under existing law, the Justice Department may make discretionary grants from the Crime Victims Fund to states to use those grants to notify victims of existing rights under state law.  While this bill does much to address the rights of sexual assault victims under federal law, states have different sets of applicable victims' rights that are particular to the state.  This provision will ensure that victims will know what rights they have in their particular states.

I want to thank Ms. Walters and Ms. Lofgren for their leadership on this very important piece of legislation.  I also want to thank Amanda Nguyen from RISE for her tireless work on this issue on behalf of victims everywhere. Also, and without objection, I would like to enter the letter, written by the victim of the Stanford rape case, into the record. As I said at the beginning, this letter captured the national spotlight on this issue and I think it is fitting that we include this in the record of a bill which will help vindicate the rights of sexual assault victims.  I urge all of you to support this important piece of legislation.",,,07/07/16 02:12 PM
361,1105322,"Chairman Brady, Republican Leaders Lay Out a #BetterWay to Fight Poverty",06/07/16,1,"Remarks as delivered:
""Good morning, I'm Kevin Brady from Texas, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. I wish all of America could meet Bishop Shirley and hear the inspiring stories that we heard today. And this is not new to our Speaker, who's been here three times, but is doing this all throughout this country. We're here because we care. We're serious about combating poverty in America, and we're serious about helping millions of Americans earn their success.

""And that's what we're talking about. 46 million Americans who live in poverty. Now that may seem like a number, but think about it this way: think about every man, woman, and child in 24 states in America who live in poverty. And they didn't just get there, they've lived there too long. And there's no hope for change, unless this government changes, unless we do things differently. And that's what this blueprint is about. We came together to look at and listen to people and leaders like Bishop Shirley and programs like this at the local level all across America looking at new and innovative ways, better ways, to help get people out of poverty and reach their God-given potential.  

""And so the principles we're focused on ought to be clear to every American. One, we're going to reward work, and we're going to expect work from those receiving government benefits. Because nowhere do you learn skills sooner, nowhere do you escape poverty faster than with a full-time job.

""We're going to get the incentives right. We're going to make sure everyone benefits, everyone's better off when someone moves from welfare to work. And that means the family, the organization that's helping them, the state, the businesses, the tax payers. Government doesn't do that well today; we're going to change that. We're going to measure results. Because at the end of the day, for a government that measures how many red-cockaded woodpeckers we have, how many toilets are in homes, how much beer content is in ale -- why aren't we measuring the lives of families who want to escape poverty? Why aren't we measuring how well we do that? And so we're going to change that as well.

""And finally, we want to bring integrity to these programs. We want to make sure the dollars get to those who need it the most in a way that helps them the most. Those principles are what drive a better way of combatting poverty in America. I'm grateful to our Speaker for bringing us together, for leading off our solutions agenda with this issue because we are going to find a better way for America. Thank you.""",,,07/07/16 02:39 PM
155964,1105408,Remarks at Pentagon Ramadan Iftar Observance,06/30/16,1,"What a spectacular looking group, and particularly for the kids. Thank you for your patience. I'll be brief, but it's important and I hope that you'll remember some of it. Lieutenant Colonel Farooq, thank you for that kind introduction. I want to thank Secretary Fanning, Eric, thanks for being here also, and welcome all of our international friends who are joining us. To our Turkish allies who are with us today this evening, my thoughts and prayers are with you, and with the families and friends of those affected by the attack in Istanbul this week. It was an attack on us all, and I want to assure you that the people of the United States stand with the extraordinary people of Turkey at this difficult time.  

I also want to thank Imam Zia Makhdoom , Imam thank you, for honoring us with your presence, thank you. Finally I want to thank Chaplain Kenneth Williams and his staff for helping to make this wonderful event a reality, as they have for so many other gatherings of faith at the Pentagon through the year, from Good Friday, to Purim, to Diwali, to Vaisakhi and every week at the Pentagon prayer breakfast, thank you. The Department of Defense is one family of many faiths, and this is a family gathering. So thank you for welcoming me and my wife Stephanie, and Ramadan Kareem to all of the Muslim servicemembers and civilians within our department.

This Ramadan includes the longest days of the year, so I'm going to be brief so you can break your fast soon. But I want to note that this Ramadan also includes the 4th of July, the day our nation was born of the self-evident truths that we're all created equal, endowed with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. All of us.

Right now, right now as we're here this evening, there are thousands of Muslim-American Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen serving and defending those ideals in every time zone, in the air, ashore, and afloat. They stand in a long line of patriots who have stepped forward throughout our history to pursue the noblest of callings, which is to protect our people, uphold humankind's highest values, and make a better world for our children.

They, and their remarkable military families, serve in the footsteps of the extraordinary Muslim-American veterans with us today, like Sheikh Nazeem Abdul Karriem, who fought on the beaches of Normandy. Sir, thank you again for being here. And Imam Ghayth Kashif, who fought in the Korean War and continues to find ways to serve today. Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you for your service, and thank you for being with us today.

Those who serve today also follow the legacy of our fallen heroes, brave Muslim-Americans like Specialist Kareem Rashad Khan, who died serving our nation in Baqouba, Iraq. To his mother Elsheba, I thank you for honoring us with your presence. We know we lack the words to do justice to what you feel as we remember your remarkable son. We can never fully know.

But we do know what your sacrifice means to us, to this nation, and to a world that still depends so much on American men and women in uniform for its security. And we are profoundly grateful.

It has been said that security is like oxygen: if you have it, you don't think about it. But if you don't have it that's all you can think of. The Muslim-Americans who now serve our nation in uniform, as well as the many more who support their mission in a civilian capacity, play a critical role in providing that oxygen to the world, alongside their fellow servicemembers and colleagues of every faith and every background.

When I became Secretary of Defense, I made a commitment to building America's force of the future -- the all-volunteer military that will defend our nation for generations to come and that will be in the future as it is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And like our outstanding force of today, our force of the future must continue to benefit from the best people America has to offer. In the 21st century, that requires drawing strength from the broadest pool of possible talent.

That's why we've opened all combat positions to women who can meet our standards. And it's why we must continue to find ways of recruiting, training and retaining the finest Americans from every community and every background in this country. To succeed in our mission of national defense, we cannot afford to cut ourselves off from any part of the country that has talent and skills.

And drawing from all of our strengths increases the experience and perspective of the force. For some of your fellow servicemembers or colleagues, you may have been the first Muslim they've gotten to know well. And so you've already given them a perspective they never had before, just as they've probably expanded your perspective as well.

That expanded perspective is critical to our mission of national defense, because it allows our men and women to thrive in uncertain situations, to understand and respect differences, and to work with others to solve seemingly intractable problems, to create new partnerships, and to build new coalitions. It spurs innovation, and builds bridges.

When I visit with foreign leaders I often hear how much they like to work with our men and women in uniform, not only because they're very capable, but because they conduct themselves decently, they're trustworthy, and they live our values --including respecting differences, and finding strength in them. Those are values that many nations around the world find to be honorable, decent, and attractive to themselves.

Many of you know what that means firsthand, whether you've helped harden our networks in the cyber domain as some of you have, or conducted exercises with our allies in the waters of the Asia Pacific, or responded to a disaster in some far off corner of the globe, your individual actions are a clear reflection of our values and our leadership. ""Strength in Faith, and Character in Service"" are not just themes for tonight's celebration, they are part of the foundation that enables everything we do around the world.

This is particularly important as we work to counter the insidious influence of organizations that seek to subvert the meaning of Islam to inspire violence and destruction. The men and women here tonight, and those observing Ramadan on every ship and every base around the world, are the most powerful argument against the twisted ideology of ISIL, Al Qaeda and any other terrorist organizations of any origin that seek to hijack faith in order to promote their brand of evil.

We all stand firm in the service of our nation to defend the very freedoms that bind us together as Americans -- not only the freedom of religion -- but liberty and justice for all. And it is through our resolve and enduring commitment to global peace and security that we will, we will, we're sure to overcome any threats to our way of life, and the corrupt ideologies that may underpin them.

Our annual Pentagon Iftar recognizes the true spirit of Ramadan, a time when Muslims recommit themselves to their faith, following days of sacrifice, discipline and patience with nights of gratitude. It is a time of renewal, a reminder of one's duty to serve one another, and to lift up the less fortunate. So, I am honored to spend my evening with you to honor the values we share: peace, charity, and forgiveness. And I am profoundly grateful to you and your families for your service and sacrifice here at home and around the world -- that's each and every one of you, including each and every one of the kids here.

So as we break the fast, let us give thanks for the opportunity to defend and live in a country founded on the principles of freedom of religion, tolerance, and mutual respect. Let us give thanks to those who have fought and died for those freedoms. And let us give thanks to God for the blessings that we share. May God bless all of you, may God bless all of our troops, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.",,,07/07/16 03:12 PM
155964,1105420,Remarks on Ending the Ban on Transgender Service in the U.S. Military,06/30/16,1,"Good afternoon.  Thanks for being here.  I'm here today to announce some changes in the Defense Department's policies regarding transgender servicemembers.

Before I announce what changes we're making, I want to explain why.  And there are three main reasons -- having to do with our future force, our current force, and matters of principle.

The first and fundamental reason is that the Defense Department and the military need to avail ourselves of all talent possible in order to remain what we are now -- the finest fighting force the world has ever known.

Our mission is to defend this country, and we don't want barriers unrelated to a person's qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine who can best accomplish the mission.  We have to have access to 100 percent of America's population for our all-volunteer force to be able to recruit from among them the most highly qualified -- and to retain them.

Now, while there isn't definitive data on the number of transgender servicemembers, RAND looked at the existing studies out there and their best estimate was that about 2,500 people out of approximately 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers and about 1,500 out of approximately 825,000 reserve servicemembers are transgender, with the upper end of their range of estimates of around 7,000 in the active component and 4,000 in the reserves.

Although relatively few in number, we're talking about talented and trained Americans who are serving their country with honor and distinction.  We invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to train and develop each individual, and we want to take the opportunity to retain people whose talent we've invested in and who have proven themselves.

And this brings me to the second reason, which is that the reality is that we have transgender servicemembers serving in uniform today, and I have a responsibility to them and to their commanders to provide them both with clearer and more consistent guidance than is provided by current policies. 

We owe commanders better guidance on how to handle questions such as deployment, medical treatment and other matters. And this is particularly true for small unit leaders, like our senior enlisteds and junior officers. 

Also, right now, most of our transgender servicemembers must go outside the military medical system in order to obtain medical care that is judged by doctors to be necessary, and they have to pay for it out of their own pockets.  This is inconsistent with our promise to all our troops that we will take care of them and pay for necessary medical treatment.

I and the Defense Department's other senior leaders who have been studying this issue over the past year have met with some of these transgender servicemembers -- they've deployed all over the world, serving on aircraft, submarines, forward operating bases, and right here in the Pentagon.  And while I learned that in most cases their peers and local commanders have recognized the value of retaining high-quality people, I also learned that the lack of clear guidelines for how to handle this issue puts the commanders and the servicemembers in a difficult and unfair position.  One servicemember I met with described how some people had urged him to leave the military because of the challenges he was facing with our policies, and he said he just wouldn't quit.  He was too committed to the mission and this was where he wanted to be.  These are the kind of people we want serving in our military.

The third and final reason, also important, is a matter of principle.  Americans who want to serve and can meet our standards should be afforded the opportunity to compete to do so.  After all, our all-volunteer force is built upon having the most qualified Americans.  And the profession of arms is based on honor and trust.

Army Chief of Staff General Milley recently reminded us of this, when he said, and I quote him, ""The United States Army is open to all Americans who meet the standard, regardless of who they are.  Embedded within our Constitution is that very principle, that all Americans are free and equal.  And we as an Army are sworn to protect and defend that very principle.  And we are sworn to even die for that principle.  So if we in uniform are willing to die for that principle, then we in uniform should be willing to live by that principle.""  That's General Milley.

In view of these three reasons to change our policy, last July I directed the commencement of a study to identify the practical issues related to transgender Americans serving openly, and to develop an implementation plan that addresses those issues consistent with military readiness -- because our mission, which is defending this country, has to come first.

I directed the working group to start with the presumption that transgender persons can serve openly without adverse impact on military effectiveness and readiness, unless and except where objective, practical impediments are identified.

It's been an educational process for a lot of people here in the Department, including me.  We had to look carefully and deliberately at medical, legal, and policy considerations that have been evolving very rapidly in recent years, and we had to take into account the unique nature of military readiness and make sure we got it right.  I'm proud of the thoughtful and deliberate manner in which the Department's leadership has pursued this review.  I've been guided throughout by one central question: is someone the best qualified servicemember to accomplish our mission?

Let me now describe the process we used to study this over the last year.

The leadership of the armed services -- the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Service Secretaries, myself, together with personnel, training, readiness, and medical specialists from across the Department of Defense -- studied the available data.  We also had the RAND Corporation analyze relevant data and studies to help us with our review.  And we got input from transgender servicemembers, from outside expert groups, and from medical professionals outside of the Department.

We looked carefully at what lessons could be learned from the outside, including from allied militaries that already allow transgender servicemembers to serve openly, and from the private sector also -- because even though we're not a business, and are different from a company in important ways, their experience and practices are still relevant.

It's worth noting, for example, that at least 18 countries already allow transgender personnel to serve openly in their militaries.  These include close allies such as the UK, Israel, and Australia, and we were able to study how they dealt with this issue. 

We also saw that among doctors, employers, and insurance companies today, providing medical care for transgender individuals is becoming common and normalized -- in both public and private sectors alike.  Today, over a third of Fortune 500 companies -- including companies like Boeing, CVS, and Ford -- offer employee health insurance plans with transgender-inclusive coverage.  That's up from zero such companies in 2002.  Similarly, non-discrimination policies at two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies now cover gender identity, up from just 3 percent in 2002.  And for the public sector, all civilian federal employees have access today to a health insurance plan that provides comprehensive coverage for transgender-related care and medical treatment.  All this represents a sea change from even just a decade ago.

Based on its analysis of allied militaries, and the expected rate at which American transgender servicemembers would require medical treatment that would impact their fitness for duty and deployability, RAND's analysis concluded that there would be ""minimal readiness impacts from allowing transgender servicemembers to serve openly.""

And in terms of cost, RAND concluded the health care costs would represent, again, their words, ""an exceedingly small proportion"" of DOD's overall health care expenditures. 

Now, as a result of this year-long study, I'm announcing today that we are ending the ban on transgender Americans in the United States military.  Effective immediately, transgender Americans may serve openly, and they can no longer be discharged or otherwise separated from the military just for being transgender.

Additionally, I have directed that the gender identity of an otherwise qualified individual will not bar them from military service, or from any accession program.

In taking these steps, we're eliminating policies that can result in transgender servicemembers being treated differently from their peers based solely upon their gender identity rather than their ability to serve.  And we're confirming that, going forward, we will apply the same general principles, standards, and procedures to transgender servicemembers as we do to all servicemembers.  What I heard from the transgender servicemembers I met with, overwhelmingly, was that they don't want special treatment, they want to be held to the same standards and be treated like everyone else.

As I directed, the study identified practical issues that arise with respect to transgender service.  And it developed an implementation plan to address those issues.  Let me briefly describe that implementation plan to address those issues. 

I want to emphasize that in this case, as in the Department's decisions on ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" and Women-in-Service, simply declaring a change in policy is not effective implementation.  That's why we have worked hard on the implementation plan and must continue to do so.

These policies will be implemented in stages over the next 12 months -- starting most immediately with guidance for current servicemembers and their commanders, followed by training for the entire force, and then beginning to access new military servicemembers who are transgender.  Implementation will begin today.

Starting today:  Otherwise qualified servicemembers can no longer be involuntarily separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment or continuation of service just for being transgender.

Then, no later than 90 days from today:  The Department will complete and issue both a commanders' guidebook for leading currently-serving transgender servicemembers, and medical guidance to doctors for providing transition-related care if required to currently-serving transgender servicemembers.  Our military treatment facilities will begin providing transgender servicemembers with all medically necessary care based on that medical guidance.  Also starting on that date, servicemembers will be able to initiate the process to officially change their gender in our personnel management systems.

Next, over the 9 months that follow, based on detailed guidance and training materials that will be prepared, the services will conduct training of the force -- from commanders, to medical personnel, to the operating force and recruiters. 

When the training is complete, no later than one year from today, the military services will begin accessing transgender individuals who meet all standards -- holding them to the same physical and mental fitness standards as everyone else who wants to join the military.

Our initial accession policy will require an individual to have completed any medical treatment that their doctor has determined is necessary in connection with their gender transition and to have been stable in their identified gender for 18 months, as certified by their doctor, before they can enter the military.  I've directed that this accession standard be reviewed no later than 24 months from today to ensure it reflects what more we learn over the next two years as this is implemented as well as the most up to date medical knowledge.

I've discussed the implementation plan with our senior military leaders, including Chairman Dunford.   The chiefs had specific recommendations about the timeline, and I made adjustments to the implementation plan timeline to incorporate those recommendations.  The Chairman has indicated that the Services support the final implementation timeline that I've laid out today.

Overall, the policies we're issuing today will allow us to access talent of transgender servicemembers to strengthen accomplishment of our mission, clarify guidance for commanders and military medical providers, and reflect better the Department's and our nation's principles.    

I want to close by emphasizing that deliberate and thoughtful implementation will be key.  I and the senior leaders of the Department will therefore be ensuring that all issues identified in the study are addressed in implementation.  I'm confident they can and will be addressed in implementation.  That's why we're taking the step-by-step approach I described.

I'm 100 percent confident in the ability of our military leaders and all our men and women in uniform to implement these changes in a manner that both protects the readiness of the force and also upholds values cherished by the military -- honor, trust, and judging every individual on their merits.

I'm also confident that we have reason to be proud today of what this will mean for our military -- because it's the right thing to do, and it's another step in ensuring that we continue to recruit and retain the most qualified people -- and good people are the key to the best military in the world.  Our military, and the nation it defends, will be stronger.

Thank you.",,,07/07/16 03:19 PM

23127,1105553,Higgins Announces New Federal Policy Expanding Access to Opioid Addiction Treatment Medication,07/06/16,1,"Congressman Brian Higgins welcomed the White House announcement of a final rule expanding access to medication-assisted treatment for those suffering from opioid addiction, measures similar to those proposed in Higgins' bill, the TREAT (The Recovery Enhancement for Addiction Treatment) Act H.R.2536. 

Buprenorphine is a drug proven to help wean those addicted to opioids off of harmful substances.  Currently over 800,000 physicians can write controlled substance prescriptions, but only about 33,000 can prescribe medication, like buprenorphine, used to treat addiction.  The number of people health professionals can help shrinks even further when you consider prescribers are limited to treating just 30 patients in the first year, and up to 100 in year two and beyond, with adequate certification.

This week the Administration announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will issue a final rule increasing the number of patients qualified health care providers can treat from 100 to 275.  The goal of increased access to medication-assisted opioid addiction treatment is a major component of Higgins' TREAT Act, which aims to eliminate the patient cap entirely and also expand prescribing authority to qualified Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners.  The expanded treatment program, for eligible prescribers, authorized by HHS will go into effect in August. 

""Action announced today will open new doors to treatment for individuals and families struggling to beat addiction,"" said Higgins.  

Expansion of medication-assisted treatment is just one of several actions aimed at addressing the epidemic outlined by the White House.  Another key component of the package is improved prescriber education to provide guidance and help medical professionals make informed decisions when prescribing addictive substances. 

This week the House and Senate continue negotiations on a final opioid legislation package.   The President requested $1.1 billion to address the opioid epidemic.  Under that proposal New York State would be eligible for up to $44 million over the next two years to expand treatment. 

According to HHS, since 1999, the rate of overdose deaths involving opioids has nearly quadrupled.   In 2014 alone opioid overdoses took the lives of more than 28,000 nationwide.",,,07/07/16 04:29 PM
130918,1105613,Leading the Way - John King Remarks at National Public Charter Schools Conference,06/28/16,1,"Introduction

Thank you, Senator Landrieu, for that warm introduction. It's a great honor to be with you as we celebrate all that's been accomplished in the quarter century since the first charter school law was passed in Minnesota.

Thank you to Nina Rees for your many contributions to this movement and as an advocate for quality education for all children.

And thank you to all of you--the teachers, principals, founders and funders here have helped make charter schools a permanent and important feature of public education in America. You know these numbers, but it bears repeating that there are now nearly 7,000 charter schools in 40 states and the District of Columbia, serving almost 3 million students.

Innovation Needed

Charter schools sprung from the ideal that if educators were freed from bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all rules, they would experiment with new ideas in service of better, more well-rounded academic and life outcomes for students. They would create more opportunities for teachers to lead, find new ways to prepare students for success in STEM and the arts, develop innovative and effective curricula, and on and on.

Twenty five years later, the need for innovation to help the nation's public schools--district and charter alike--solve big challenges has not faded.

Today, I'm going to talk about some of the successes along the way, and I'm also going to challenge us all to lead the way on school discipline--a topic where, candidly, we haven't always lived up to our collective ideals.

We can point to many places where innovation at high-quality charter schools has produced demonstrable success in closing achievement gaps; creating academically successful, racially and socioeconomically diverse school communities; and developing diverse pipelines of teachers and school leaders.

At YES Prep Public Schools' 15 campuses across Houston, for example, most of the students come from low-income families, and the schools report that, not only do their graduates finish high school, nearly three quarters have earned or are working toward college degrees. As a nation, we need more schools--charter and district--that are closing achievement gaps and equipping students, regardless of their race or zip code, with the academic and socioemotional skills they will need to not just get to college, but through college.

High Tech High schools in California are showing us what it takes to not only recruit a true mix of racial and economic backgrounds, but to also have students of different backgrounds work side-by-side on projects in their classrooms. Their student body is 63 percent students of color and 42 percent qualify for free and reduced-price lunch. They also are sending 96 percent of their graduates on to college. We need more schools--charter and district--that are serving diverse populations well.

One of my favorite programs to work on at Uncommon Schools was their summer teaching fellowship with diverse college juniors, many of whom were Uncommon alumni. In a context where a majority of our nation's students are students of color, but only 18 percent of our teachers are teachers of color, more of these kinds of intentional efforts to create a real pipeline of diverse educators are desperately needed.

I could fill the rest of this speech with examples of charter schools--including individual operators--that are showcasing innovative solutions to critical challenges.

But, we also have to acknowledge that a significant number of charter schools are not fulfilling their central mission: preparing students for success in college, careers, and life. Those schools hurt the reputations of all charter schools and undermine the foundational charter school covenant of greater freedom in exchange for greater accountability. So it's in all of our interest--and the national interest--for authorizers and the sector to demand excellence and to act forcefully when schools are failing their students.

And, while there are great successes to be proud of, today I want to ask you to take on a challenge that desperately needs leadership and innovation--rethinking discipline.

Innovation on Discipline

The Department of Education recently released data from our Civil Rights Data Collection survey showing that nearly 3 million students were suspended during the 2013-2014 school year. Not surprisingly, the problem is worse for students of color--especially black students. In fact, the suspension rate for African-American students in pre-K is more than three times that of white students; and, in K-12, nearly four times the rate for white students.

We know that students who are suspended are more likely to be retained in grade or to drop out, and we know exclusionary discipline feeds the school-to-prison pipeline. That is why this Administration--including through the President's My Brother's Keeper initiative--has made rethinking school discipline practices one of our top K-12 priorities.

As you know, this is an area where some charter schools have received a lot of negative attention. Not all of the criticism has been fair or accurate. But, as a whole, it is true that charter schools suspend a higher percentage of their students than do district schools. And students of color are more likely to be suspended in charter schools than in district schools.

It's not all bad news: The overall suspension rate in charter schools as well as district schools has fallen since the 2011-2012 school year.

Still, as a nation, we need to do better. And--despite some shining examples that I'll talk about in a minute--it certainly cannot yet be said that the charter sector is leading the way.

So my challenge to you is this: don't get caught up in battles about whether charters are a little better or a little worse than average on discipline. Instead, focus on innovating to lead the way for the sake of our students. We know that, in every school, no matter how successful, there is more we can do to reach the students who are not yet succeeding and more we can do to equip students with not just the fundamental academic skills, but the socioemotional skills needed for success in life. That is the spirit with which we must approach the work of rethinking discipline.

We need safe and positive school environments, but as we consider struggling students we must ask ourselves critical questions: Could socioemotional supports like counseling or mentoring relationships make a difference? Could instruction be strengthened to achieve better engagement or more appropriate differentiation? Could training on issues of implicit bias or culturally relevant pedagogy change the outcome of a particular interaction? Could parents or family members be engaged more effectively as partners? Could more learning time yield a better outcome than exclusion from the learning environment?

In rethinking discipline, charters also have the opportunity to lead the way on equity. The students who are most likely to be suspended and expelled are students who we already fail too often.

As we reflect on the kids who we are most worried about, we have to return to the original meaning of ""no excuses."" It was never about ""no excuses"" for the kids. It was always about ""no excuses"" for ourselves as educators--no blaming parents, no blaming neighborhoods--and asking ourselves, ""What could we, the adults in school, do differently to change outcomes?""

Let me be clear, the end goal isn't just to reduce suspensions or expulsions. It is to help our students learn how to succeed in whatever setting they find themselves, in school and beyond.

In rethinking discipline, charters have the opportunity to lead the way on professional reflection and growth. I'll start by admitting that I had an internal debate about whether to even raise this issue today--whether I could capture its complexity. As you know, I was a co-founder of Roxbury Prep--a charter school in Boston--where we had high expectations for students' behavior as well as for their academic pursuits. And as a managing director at Uncommon Schools, we sought to scale the success of Roxbury Prep and other early high-performing, urban charters.

What I know from those experiences, and what I've learned since, is that discipline is a nuanced and complicated issue. Yet the public discussion of these issues is often binary--pitting one extreme against another. It's ""zero tolerance"" or chaos. Authoritarian control or no discipline at all. So, I'll say up front: I am not here to offer any hard-and-fast rules or directives. But, I believe the goal for all schools should be to create a school culture that motivates students to want to do their best, to support their classmates and to give back to their community, and to communicate in ways big and small to our students and educators that their potential is unlimited.

That was our starting point at Roxbury Prep and I'm proud of the many successes we had. Proud that we became one of the highest-performing middle schools in Massachusetts. Proud that our students went on to graduate college at five times the rate of other demographically similar students. Proud that we created a positive, healthy school climate in many ways. And especially proud when I think of my Roxbury Prep students who went on to become teachers at Roxbury Prep themselves.

But today, with the benefit of all we have learned over the last nearly 20 years, the leaders of Uncommon are rightly rethinking discipline. Early on, we had begun to integrate school counseling, mentoring, and support groups, but we did not do it fast enough.

We all must commit to accelerate exactly this kind of work.

In rethinking discipline, charters have the opportunity to lead the way by ensuring that high expectations for behavior are about love and growth.

Of course, we need structures, systems, and routines that support learning environments that are efficient, safe, and engaging. We have a LOT of work to do with our students; and, of course, we need to communicate that urgency. But, this does not change the fact that norms around behavior must be grounded in equipping them with tools for success.

When we asked our students to sit up straight, to make eye contact, or to listen respectfully to classmates' ideas, it wasn't about rules for rules' sake. Instead, we tried to explain to students that we were practicing life skills necessary for success. I know today that I am grateful that the adults in my life taught me how to model professional behavior and I want nothing less for my students--or my daughters.

We aspire to have our students be the next generation of leaders, critical thinkers, and problem solvers. To get there, we need school climates in which the behavioral norms foster the safe, academically engaging environment needed for rich intellectual exploration and debate, and students understand the ""why"" behind those behavioral norms.

In rethinking discipline, charters have the opportunity to lead the way by modeling problem solving for our students. The Camino Nuevo Charter Academies in Los Angeles have student success teams that meet every week to discuss how to help struggling students. Together, students, families, teachers, and counselors work through problems. They aim to understand, not just to punish. When a fourth grader named Diego was acting out, the success team learned his father had died the year before and Diego was craving male attention. They got Diego into counseling and rewarded his better choices with lunchtime reading sessions with a favorite male assistant principal.

Their approach is that it's less about just enforcing the rules, and more about really getting to know the kids and finding ways to give them what they need to thrive.

In rethinking discipline, charters have the opportunity to lead the way on professional development. Our educators need to understand the implicit biases each of us brings to our work, despite our good intentions, and be able to handle challenging student behaviors in effective, culturally responsive ways.

We are seeing in districts and charters across the country that new policies on discipline only succeed when coupled with strong implementation strategies and training for teachers and administrators.

At Mastery Charter Schools in Philadelphia and Camden, all new teachers participate in a summer onboarding program and ongoing professional learning communities that help them understand restorative practices, how to respond to their students' traumas, and what it means to teach in culturally responsive ways.

Restorative justice is a particularly powerful approach because it helps students understand the impact of their actions and words on others--a skill that will help them succeed in personal and professional relationships throughout their lives.

Working in this way helped one of the Mastery schools find out why an eighth grader lashed out at a teacher. School leaders learned that, when he was 10, the student had been placed in foster care after he had repeatedly been left alone to care for his younger sister. His mother had suffered from mental health issues. She was physically and emotionally abusive, and the student was experiencing PTSD. Educators arranged for him to meet regularly with the school's fulltime social worker. The student now knows his teachers are not going to give up on him and he is on track to graduate.

In rethinking discipline, charters have the opportunity to lead the way by shattering misconceptions. We know that a welcoming environment and world-class academics are not mutually exclusive. In fact, research suggests that positive school climates are a major contributing factor to student achievement.

Walter L. Cohen High School in New Orleans has cut its suspension rate in half while the percentage of its students who are proficient has increased from 47 percent to 70 percent. Four years ago, the school received an F rating; this year it received a B. Clearly, rethinking its approach to discipline has not hurt it academically.

There is nothing magic about what this and other schools are doing to reduce suspensions and create positive learning environments. We believe in the vast potential of our children. We know what it takes to unleash it. We do it every day, in our classrooms.

When a student fails a math assessment, we don't suspend him. We work with him, one-on-one, sometimes for hours and hours after school. We don't give up. We show him we believe in him and nourish his belief in himself.

So why take a different approach to our discipline work? We must be careful to communicate--as we would with our own children--that while we may be disappointed in a particular behavior, we have faith in the student and we will support his or her growth.

Before I close, let me share a very personal perspective on this issue. The students who are frustrating us most, are often the ones who need the most from us. I know from my own life, that when I wasn't handling rules and structures well, it was because of the chaos of my life--and what I needed was compassion, attention, and engaging learning.

I lost both of my parents when I was a kid--my mom when I was eight and my dad when I was twelve. Before he died, my father was quite sick with undiagnosed Alzheimer's and home during those four years with just the two of us in the house was often scary and unpredictable. After that I moved around between family members and schools. Amazing teachers in New York City public schools literally saved my life--they created an environment that was safe, stable, engaging, and nurturing. If not for them, I wouldn't be standing here. But, as a teenager, I was angry about my experiences, and rebelled against authority. I made lots of mistakes. I actually did get kicked out of high school.

But teachers at the next high school I went to did not give up on me. They could have looked at me and said, ""Here is an African-American, Latino male student from Brooklyn with a family in crisis who got kicked out of school, what chance does he have?"" But, instead, they gave me a second chance and--together with some extended family members--helped me find my way.

Now it's our turn to lead the way.

Thank you.",,,07/07/16 04:48 PM

""By the authority vested in me, pursuant to part II, Article 44 of the New Hampshire Constitution, on June 9, 2016, I have vetoed House Bill 533, relative to installation requirements for arc-fault circuit interrupters.

""Arc-fault protection is a significant advancement in electrical system technology that helps prevent fires from overheated and arcing wires, potentially saving lives and preventing property loss. House Bill 533 would allow an exemption to the use of arc-fault circuit interrupters after repeated tripping and after determination that the branch circuit is the not cause. However, this bill does not take into consideration what the actual cause of the nuisance tripping is, potentially reducing the level of fire protection in homes and threatening public safety.

""Arc-fault protection can reduce the chance of an electrical fire occurring. Simply switching the arc-fault protection to another device without this protection against fires -- without understanding the root cause of the electrical system issues -- takes away from New Hampshire families an important protection of the electrical code that works and helps save lives.

""Additionally, New Hampshire has established a State Building Code Review Board to ensure the technical expertise of professionals is an important part of our process when considering changes to the building code. That process was not followed in this case, and in fact, the Building Code Review Board opposes this legislation.

""America is the greatest country on earth. 

""We don't have to settle for a second rate economy where paychecks are flat and millions of qualified Americans can't find full-time work. 

""And why is America growing weaker while our foreign competitors grow stronger? 

""The problem is the costly, complex and unfair tax code that Washington imposes on hard-working taxpayers.  

""House Republicans, led by our Speaker Paul Ryan, see a better way. And today we propose a new tax code for the American people -- a tax code built for growth: for the growth of paychecks, for the growth of local jobs and economy, and the growth of America's economy. 

""First, we unleash new job creation with the lowest taxes in modern history on local businesses -- small or large, corporations or family-owned.  And here's why: Washington must take less from these job creators so they can grow the local economy rather than Washington's economy. 

""For the first time in history, we'll change the way America taxes its businesses so they can compete and win, whether on Main Street or in Madrid. And when they win, they will not be charged one dime to bring those profits back home here to America to be invested in good jobs, research and growth. 

""For the first time we'll end the penalties in the current tax code that too often force American companies to move their jobs, their technologies and headquarters overseas. No longer will we be the only major country that still taxes its own exports. No longer will American products lose-out to foreign competitors simply because they are proudly stamped ""Made in America.'

""For the first time, local businesses will be able to immediately write off unlimited investments in buildings, equipment and technology. 

""This new wave of business investment coursing through our local economies will be a strong catalyst for more jobs along Main Street. 

""For the first time since it was established in 1916, we will end the Death Tax so family-owned farms and businesses will never again fear the IRS swooping in and taking nearly half of the nest egg they worked a lifetime to build. 

""The result of this ""built for growth' tax code is that America will leapfrog from dead last among our competitors to firmly in the lead pack of pro-jobs tax codes in the world. 

""Growth is good, everywhere but in the size of the tax code. Americans are sick of this huge, complex tax code riddled with special breaks for others -- and nothing but headaches for them. For years hardworking American taxpayers have asked Washington for a tax code so simple, and fair and understandable that it could fit on a postcard. 

""We've been listening, and that is exactly what we propose: for the first time in modern history a tax code simple and fair enough to fit on a postcard. 

""This postcard form will simplify the number of tax brackets by more than half. It will take less from taxpayers at every income level, because Washington takes too much of your hard-earned dollars. And to make it easier to save for retirement and grow the local economy, we will cut taxes on savings and investment to half the regular rate. 

""The postcard we propose will include help with the basics: home and children, charity and college.  It will be that simple. It will be that fair.  

""But make no mistake. America, this is not our tax code, it's yours. You deserve a real say in how you are taxed. So before this new tax reform proposal is introduced into law, we will be asking the American people: Do you want simple and fair as a postcard, or more complicated with more loopholes and sending more money to Washington?  

""We will be listening. 

""And finally, a simpler, fairer tax code demands a simpler, fairer tax collector. We will bust up the IRS as it is today, redesigning it into three smaller, more focused units to serve businesses, to provide state-of the-art taxpayer service for families and individuals, and to quickly and affordably resolve tax disputes -- in essence, an independent and unbiased ""small claims court' so families and small businesses aren't forced to spend thousands of dollars to resolve routine tax differences.   

""Here is the challenge going forward: Tax reform only happens once a generation. And it can be too easily hijacked by Washington and special interests. 

""At this urgent moment in history, as America struggles to regain its standing in the world and Americans struggle to regain their standard of living, we can't afford to continue to struggle under this tax code.  

""House Republicans believe it's time for a change. It's time, America, to let your voice be heard. 

""If you want more local jobs, speak up. 

""If you want a simple fair postcard, speak up. 

""If you want to stop fearing the IRS, speak up. 

""And, like us, if you want America to be the strongest economy on earth for you and your children, it's time to speak up.

9490,1105663,"Live Updates on the Attacks on Law Enforcement in Dallas, Texas",07/08/16,1,"As law enforcement continues to gather more information, here's what we know: On the night of July 7, 2016, the police in dallas who were keeping people safe during a peaceful protest were targeted. At least eleven officers were shot, five were killed, and others were injured -- including one civilian. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings reported this morning that one shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 

While in Warsaw, Poland for the NATO Summit, President Obama offered the following statement:  

 Transcript: 

With your understanding, I want to begin with a few words about the situation back in the United States, specifically the situation in Dallas, Texas.  

My team has been keeping me updated throughout the morning of the evening in Dallas.  I spoke this morning with Mayor Rawlings of Dallas to convey the deepest condolences of the American people.  I told him that the federal government will provide whatever assistance Dallas may need as it deals with this tremendous tragedy. 

We still don't know all the facts.  What we do know is that there has been a vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement.  Police in Dallas were on duty, doing their jobs, keeping people safe during peaceful protests.  These law enforcement officers were targeted, and nearly a dozen officers were shot.  Five were killed.  Other officers and at least one civilian were wounded -- some are in serious condition, and we are praying for their recovery.  

As I told Mayor Rawlings, I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events, and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas.  According to police, there are multiple suspects.  We will learn more, undoubtedly, about their twisted motivations.  But let's be clear:  There is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement. The FBI is already in touch with the Dallas police, and anyone involved in these senseless murders will be held fully accountable.  Justice will be done. 

I will have more to say about this as the facts become more clear.  For now, let me just say that even as yesterday I spoke about our need to be concerned, as all Americans, about racial disparities in our criminal justice system, I also said yesterday that our police have an extraordinarily difficult job and the vast majority of them do their job in outstanding fashion.  I also indicated the degree to which we need to be supportive of those officers who do their job each and every day, protecting us and protecting our communities. 

Today is a wrenching reminder of the sacrifices that they make for us.  We also know that when people are armed with powerful weapons, unfortunately it makes attacks like these more deadly and more tragic. And in the days ahead, we're going to have to consider those realities as well. 

In the meantime, today our focus is on the victims and their families.  They are heartbroken.  The entire city of Dallas is grieving.  Police across America, which is a tight-knit family, feels this loss to their core.  And we're grieving with them.  I'd ask all Americans to say a prayer for these officers and their families.  Keep them in your thoughts.  And as a nation, let's remember to express our profound gratitude to our men and women in blue -- not just today, but every day.",,,07/08/16 08:31 AM
1535,1105894,Coffman Works With Local Physician To Push Stem-Cell Therapy Bill,06/29/16,1,"As most congressional watchers begin to turn their attention to the November elections, U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman canvassed the northern Front Range on Wednesday -- not for campaign purposes, but to make a last-ditch effort to move a health-care bill of his that has been stuck in limbo.

Coffman, an Aurora Republican, is the House sponsor of the REGROW Act, which would speed physicians' ability to use experimental stem-cell therapies, allowing for clinical trials on patients once safety, rather than safety and efficacy, is demonstrated. He argues that such a streamlining of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval process not only would give patients access to life-changing therapies but would save hundreds of millions of dollars for Medicare by allowing expensive surgeries to be replaced in many cases by injections of stem cells.

Coffman is facing several obstacles. First, FDA officials oppose the bill, arguing that it will undermine the current testing process that's in place to ensure drugs and therapies are proper for mass usage before they hit the market. Second, he faces a packed calendar before the congressional session adjourns at the end of this year, and even getting a hearing will be tough, he acknowledged.

But in his effort to advance the bill, Coffman on Wednesday visited the Centeno-Schultz Clinic in Broomfield, a privately funded center for regenerative medicine that researches the effectiveness of stem-cell treatments and trains about 1,000 doctors a year on how to use the therapies to replace expensive surgeries in many cases. After that visit, he was headed to Fort Collins, hoping to meet with researchers at Colorado State University who have been doing stem-cell research for more than 10 years.

""I think it's important to prioritize it,"" Coffman said. ""If we can come across something that's less invasive with better outcomes and cheaper, it could be a game changer.""

Centeno and other physicians from his clinic have been tracking about 11,000 patients they've treated over the past 11 years and have found that injecting stem cells to partially torn joints can cut back on the number of orthopedic surgeries by 70 percent.

In instances of ACL tears or rotator cuff injuries, doctors have gone into the joints with ultrasound guidance, found the tears and injected cells into those areas. The recovery time is much quicker, the morbidity rate zero and the costs for such procedures drop from some $25,000 for knee replacements to about $6,000, he said.

FDA rules now give those physicians carte blanche on standard injections that are considered non-invasive procedures. But stem cells that are taken from fat, that are cultured or that are modified genetically are considered drugs -- and the FDA has not given approval for those to be used in the U.S., despite lengthy studies, Centeno said.

Because of that, physicians from the Regenexx network -- a group of about 35 locations throughout the U.S. and in select overseas locations for which the Centeno-Schultz Clinic is the headquarters -- must take patients to their locations in Grand Cayman, the Bahamas or Japan for such procedures. And without FDA approval, those procedures are largely limited to self-paying clients rather than Medicare patients or others who could benefit from them Centeno said.

Centeno asked Coffman Wednesday to ensure in any legislation that passes that the FDA does not reverse course on non-invasive stem-cell therapy procedures and rule that they too must go through the full drug-testing process, which could take a decade or more and require tens of millions of dollars to be spent on trials. Coffman replied that if he can't work it into the existing bill, he can think about running a stand-alone resolution on that matter.

The question now is whether Coffman can persuade House leaders to use the remaining months of this Congress to advance the bill.

""Technology has historically increased health-care costs,"" said the fourth-term congressman, who faces a high-profile challenge from Democratic state Sen. Morgan Carroll in the election this year. ""This is an opportunity for an advancement that can reduce costs and improve outcomes.""",,,07/08/16 10:06 AM
111064,1105995,Governor Christie On Asbury Park: We Have Much To Celebrate Here,06/10/16,1,"It's always great for me to come back to Asbury Park. It's not the summer yet for me if I haven't gotten to Asbury Park and so I'm glad that I got to do it early in the summer season and yes I am intending on walking along the boardwalk and seeing some of the continued development and the businesses and the folks who are, you know, once again seeing the Asbury Park boardwalk as one of the truly iconic places in the state of New Jersey and something that's essential stop if you want to experience the Jersey Shore experience in the summer. Everything here, from the history of music at the Stone Pony to Madame Marie's to the Silver Ball Museum, all of those places are places that are really important to New Jersey's history, to New Jersey's culture, and to what we've come to mean not only to this region but to the country and to the world, Asbury Park, and being the mayor of Asbury Park and being able to say Greetings from Asbury Park. You bet John I'm definitely guilty of using that line myself many times but you're the one as the mayor who owns that one. It's come a long way, Asbury Park, from the times when I was a young, young person when my parents used to bring me here for vacation in the summer, myself and my younger brother, to the times when things were truly bad here, and the song My City of Ruins could apply to this place and was the inspiration for Bruce writing that song. Now we have much, much, much to celebrate here. When you look at what has happened, the repurposing of this into a really beautiful 110 room boutique hotel, it's pretty amazing.     Now we have much, much, much to celebrate here. When you look at what has happened, the repurposing of this into a really beautiful 110 room boutique hotel, it's pretty amazing what not only private sector investment and public sector partnership can do but more importantly, what the imagination and the ingenuity of people who understand what this city is all about and what it's potential is for the future can really develop. I encourage all of you, if haven't, to take a look around here and then encourage your friends and your family to come here, it's really important, important work. I want to thank iStar too, for investing in the community here and Asbury Park through job and employment training programs and community building activities with local vendors and their support of the Boys and Girls Club of Monmouth County, all really important things to have private sector partners willing to invest in. Everyone needs to come down to the Jersey Shore. It's a great place to come not only because of the great, and Asbury Park probably has if not the best, one of the best beaches in the entire state of New Jersey for people to enjoy but here the culture that The Asbury Hotel represents is what makes Asbury Park different than a lot of other places up and down the Jersey Shore. You can find great restaurants here, great music here, all within walking distance of the boardwalk. And so if you come and you spend a week or a weekend at The Asbury Hotel, you're going to be able to experience great food, a great beach, and great entertainment. And that's a really, really welcome change from where we were even when I first became Governor, seven years ago.",,,07/08/16 10:45 AM
111064,1105999,"Governor Christie On Transportation Spending: Every Dollar Is Yours, Not Mine",06/13/16,1,"On the proposed TTF solution, they want to double municipal aid from $200 million to $400 million and increase the TTF from $1.6 billion to $2 billion a year. And 50% of that increase will be give backs to municipalities for them to pave their roads. When did we get in the business of spending 20% of state money on paving municipal roads? Yet, I read all the editorials say, oh there's a crisis on state roads and a crisis on state bridges, even though by the way, we've been $1.6  billion a year every year that I've been governor repairing those things. There's a crisis all of a sudden. Okay, if there's a crisis, what are you doing doubling the amount of money to municipalities? When they do that, let me tell you something, you know what that is? It is a payoff to protect their political backsides. Payoff the local mayors, payoff the local council, so they'll endorse the local assemblyman and local senator. And don't let them fool you that it's property tax relief. Please, they'll just pave more. You know what's going on here. They want to raise to $2 billion have them spend more on mass transit for the state, have them spend more on our state roads and bridges, double the amount of money to municipalities and they have no clue in that plan what they would do with that money. It just sounds good. Double it, excellent, good, and you'll pay. Look at the fine print everybody. The fine print's important because all of that money, every dollar is yours, it's yours, not mine, not ours, it's yours. And that's been the attitude of this government for the last six and half years, that every day I am the steward of your money. When I have vetoed every supplemental spending bill since I've been governor, every one, it's because I say, you want it, put it in the budget in June, not during the year. That's fiscal responsibility. You don't do it in your business, we shouldn't do it with your money. All of those principles will go out the door in 2018 if you make some bad choices in the next 18 months so it's time to fight the fight everybody and I am up for it. I am ready.

111064,1106006,Constitutional Pension Payment Amendment: Everyone's Taxes Will Rise,06/13/16,1,"What do you see happening now? What you see happening now, is already, the Democrats, 18 months away from the trough, are signaling what they will do if they get power back. They announced with great fanfare on Friday, that they want to increase the gas tax. Now, because I with you have been pounding for years about the fact that we need tax fairness, they've included some tax reductions in there as well, not nearly enough for my taste. And that's a discussion I'm sure we'll be having in Trenton over the course of the next three weeks. But it gives you an indication, look at the size of the increase they want. To start with, we have a 14 and a half cent a gallon gas tax, one of the lowest in the nation. They are advocating for a 23 cent increase, a more than doubling of the gas tax. And there's more if you look into the bill, there's more tax increases in there as well that will effect some of the business sitting here. I've said all along, I will not sign a gas tax increase unless it represents tax fairness for the people of New Jersey. They've got work to do. Now in the next three weeks they're considering something that is going to be even more destructive, if you can imagine, than that. First of all, we must start with the premise that is indisputable at this point, that the teacher's union owns the democratic party in New Jersey, lock stock and barrel. And the proof for that is, they are putting forward a proposed constitutional amendment to be on the ballot this November, to require quarterly payments into the pension system, that will necessitate, in order to make them, and there will be no exception because they will be constitutional if this passes, at least a $3 billion tax increase on the people of New Jersey. $3 billion, a $3 billion dollar tax increase on 8.1 million people to pay for the outsized, outrageous benefits of 800,000 people. Understand what a $3 billion dollar, I want to quantify it for you, so you know how you get an additional $3 billion at the level of taxation we're already at, because it's not easy. There's only two ways. You know there's only three real taxes that create revenue for the state government, the income tax, the sales tax, and the corporate business tax. Now, the corporate business tax, in total now, only generates about $2 billion in $34 billion in revenue. So you couldn't raise the corporate business tax enough to get $3 billion. So some of you in the room can breathe a sigh of relief, but not if you live here, because if you live here, the other two taxes are the ones they're going to come get. And here's what they'll need to do to raise $3 billion. The current sales tax is 7%. To get $3 billion you must raise it to 10%. Imagine, a 10% sales tax, on the people of New Jersey and what that would do to our businesses across the state and to the people who have to buy things here. Or you could have this combination of income tax increases, the millionaires tax surcharge that they've just been pining to get for the last six years, in which I've vetoed five times. But that only raises on its best day, about a half a billion dollars. So you need another $2.5 billion to get to the magic number. What that will mean is for every person who pays income tax in the state, every person, not just the wealthy, every person, and additional 29% increases in the income tax. That's the only way you get to these numbers.",,,07/08/16 10:53 AM
111064,1106020,Governor Christie At PSE&G Groundbreaking: We Are Stronger Post-Sandy Than We Were Before,06/14/16,1,"In the end nothing will ever be perfect and there will always be times where we are challenged by Mother Nature but we learned an extraordinary amount three and a half years ago. I want to point out to people once again that in Mississippi, in Louisiana, they are still recovering from Katrina. They still have entire neighborhoods that are empty. They still have infrastructure that is not rebuilt and three and a half years after the second worst natural disaster in American history, New Jersey is rebuilt. We have almost all of our residents back into their homes three and a half years after 365,000 homes were destroyed in a 24 hour period. We have infrastructure not only rebuilt and operating, that's an old story, that's been happening for years, but now you're seeing the outgrowth of it where we are making ourselves better and strongest post-Sandy than we were before. This is a record that folks will look back on and see that doing that in three and a half years is extraordinary when compared to the most comparable storm that we had in this country, which is Katrina. Which a decade later, much of what we have already done here in New Jersey in three and a half years is still not done in Mississippi and Louisiana. So we couldn't do that without partners in the legislature, partners in the executive branch, but also without our partners in the private sector. So Ralph thank you for providing the leadership at PSE&G that makes it possible to do these things, thanks to our friends in the trade unions, who their men and women have stood up not only as victims of Sandy, as many of them were, but they got back right to work, because they knew that helping to rebuild what they were helping to rebuild, were going to help themselves and their neighbors and friends as well. And to thank all of our friends in the construction business who continue to stand ready to work with a willing government to be able to build greater infrastructure in this state and to make the state the envy of others who have gone through some of the challenges we've gone through and recovered very, very well, so Ralph thank you very much for inviting me here today. It's great to see projects started and projects completed. I look forward to seeing this one done in a couple of years. Thank you all for coming.",,,07/08/16 10:57 AM

It's a challenging and difficult world as all of you know. And your work will help to make that a world that is much more manageable for them. Where I hope that they'll be able to find what you believe you found, which is a calling in life, a calling to do something that, whether it's for your whole life or just a part of it, that's special and that helps to contribute to the betterment of other human beings, not just to the enrichment of yourself. That's why I think any type of public service for part of every person's life is something that they should consider doing because it helps to reemphasize to us that there are things greater than our own self-interest. And you are going to be living, breathing examples of that for every young man and women who are in your classrooms. And that's a really, really special thing. And I will tell you, they will remember you. The most special teachers I've had, I remember. I remember them. And everything you do in your life and you decide as an adult; comes from your family, from your friends, and from those people who educated you. So you join a special class of people. And I suspect you're here because you're already pretty special in your own right. That's a good combination. So on behalf of the students you have yet to meet and their families who I represent, I thank you for what you're doing.

111064,1106056,Governor Chris Christie's Speech On The Fairness Formula As Prepared For Delivery,06/21/16,1,"We have two separate, but completely intertwined crises in New Jersey that must be dealt with.  They must be dealt with honestly and directly.  We cannot wait any longer to do it.  Property taxes and the failure of urban education.

Both of these crises are hurting all New Jerseyans, those affected both directly and indirectly. 

Property taxes are the highest in America and the majority of those taxes are for local school taxes.

Urban education, despite 30 years of Supreme Court required intervention by the state, is still failing students and their parents at an alarming rate.  The theory from the Supreme Court was that money would solve the problem. 

They were wrong. Very wrong. And the results prove it.  They have not solved our failures in urban education and, in the process, have led to New Jersey to be amongst the highest taxed states in America.  They have required the legislature and Governors to craft ridiculous school funding formulas that cheat thousands of families out of funding and thousands more from a valuable education.  Those days must end.  It is time to change the failed school funding formulas and replace it with one that will force the end of these two crises--the property tax scandal and the disgrace of failed urban education.

New Jersey spends the 3rd most in the nation per pupil on K-12 education.  For the upcoming fiscal year we spend 13.3 billion dollars on aid to K-12 education.  How do we spend it?  $9.1 billion goes back to school districts in direct aid.  $3.25 billion is to pay for the pensions and health benefits for retired teachers.   $936 million goes to pay the debt on schools, mostly in urban districts, to build new schools.  $13.3 billion--and that does not count the money paid in local property taxes.

Who gets the $9.1 billion? Well, that begins to tell the story.  By order of the Supreme Court, and coerced acquiescence by the elected branches of government, this coming year $5.1 billion goes to the 31 urban or SDA districts.  $4 billion goes to the remaining 546 districts.  That's right.  58% of the aid from the state's taxpayers goes to 5% of the state's school districts. 42% of the aid goes to the remaining 95% of our districts.  This is absurd.  This is unfair.  This is not working.  And it hasn't been working for 30 years.

Over the last 30 years, New Jersey taxpayers have sent $97 billion to the 31 SDA school districts.  The other 546 districts in the state received $9 billion less over the same 30 years.  $97 billion divided among only 31 SDA districts while the families in 546 other districts had to divide $9 billion less.  The inequity is appalling and it has only gotten worse as the years have passed.

In 1990, 23% of the state's students, representing the SDA districts, got 41% of the state aid.  Today, while still representing only 23% of the state's students, they receive 59% of the state aid.

Has that enormous differential in state aid brought greater achievement in the 31 districts?  No. Absolutely not.  Tragically so for the families in those districts and for the taxpayers all across New Jersey who have been footing the bill for the last 30 years.

Just take a sample of graduation rates.  The statewide graduation rate is 90%.  How have we done in the 31 districts where we have invested $97 billion over the last 30 years?  Asbury Park--66%.  Camden--63%.  New Brunswick--68%.  Newark--69%.  Trenton--68%.  27 of the 31 districts are below the state average, despite the exorbitant spending over the last 30 years.  Spending does not equal achievement--never has and never will.  There are  exceptions and those should be noted right here.  In Harrison, Long Branch, Millville and Pemberton they have exceeded the statewide graduation rate.  In Union City, the have seen extraordinary growth under very trying circumstances and the leadership in those districts deserve great credit.  But despite nearly $100 billion to those 31 districts in the last 30 years from taxpayers all over New Jersey, failure is still the rule, not the exception.  That is an unacceptable, immoral waste of the hard earned money of the people of New Jersey.

Worse than the wasted money is the lives that were not given the chance to reach their full potential.  We accept that subpar performance and pay a fortune for it.

Do not let anyone tell you that failure is inevitable for children in those 31 districts or that money is the answer.  The Academy Charter High School in Asbury Park had an 89% graduation rate compared to 66% in Asbury Park; Academy spends $17,000 per pupil while the traditional public schools spend $33,000 per pupil.  The LEAP Academy Charter School has a 98% graduation rate in Camden, while the district has a 63% rate; LEAP spends 16,000 per pupil while the school district spends $25,000 per pupil.  In Newark, the North Star Academy Charter has an 87% graduation compared to the citywide rate of 69%; North Star spends $13,000 per pupil compared to $22,000 per pupil district wide.

Over and over again we see the same issue:  money spent without results for the families we are meant to serve.  It is a false claim and always has been.  It is failing families and their children.  It is bankrupting our state. It is driving families from their homes and New Jersey.
The failure of the educational system in those 31 districts is the first tragedy.  The second tragedy is this system has caused us to have the highest property taxes in the nation.

New Jerseyans regularly say that the issue that is their number one concern is property taxes.  The highest in the nation and a burden on families in every corner of New Jersey.  What drives these taxes?  52% of property taxes statewide are spent on the school tax and in many districts it is as high as two-thirds.  But here is the unintended consequence of the unfair school funding formula:  in those 31 SDA districts, they spend a fraction of their property taxes on schools as compared to the rest of the state.  That's right--the statewide average percentage of property taxes spent on schools is 52%; in the 31 SDA districts it is half that--only 26%.  Are they taxing less? Oh no, they are just growing the size of their municipal government.  The statewide average percentage speThe issue that in every poll that you see for my lifetime has been named by the people of New Jersey as the most important issue: reducing property taxes. The 2% cap has restrained property taxes and if we pass this school funding formula, you will see why the 2% cap is so important because if you give them all this money, believe me they'll want to spend it. But with a 2% cap they'll only be able to spend 2% of the new money they get. The 98% has to go back to you, where it came from, in the first place. And I suspect, that when we stop encouraging the idea that money equals achievement and when we start supporting the methods put in place by these charter schools in urban areas that are showing such extraordinary achievement at a fraction of the cost, that we can fix the urban education problem at the same time. Necessity is the mother of invention everybody. If we give everybody $33,000 a year to graduate 66% of their students they're just going to keep doing it. If you tell them that the charter school down the street graduates 89% of their students with half the money- maybe they might want to wander down the street and see how they're doing it. And maybe we could break the special interests of the state on the old orthodox. It's up to us. I'm going to be the voice for this and I welcome as many people to this cause as are willing to join me. 75% of the districts in the state do better, it's time for your voices to be heard. It's been 30 years of a failed social experiment by a group of lawyers in black robes. It's time for the people to take control back of this issue and apply common sense to it. Every child in this state deserves to be treated equally. And every child in this state deserves an education that prepares them for the job or the education that they want to pursue. We're failing on both fronts and it's an unacceptable failure because we see the solution in front of us because we just choose not to do it because we don't have the will. I have the will. And I think you do too.nt on municipal government is 30%; in the 31 SDA districts it is nearly double--a whopping 54%!  When you look at some of the individual districts, it is appalling.  Asbury Park spends 60% less of their property tax dollars on schools than the state average, while their city spends 64% more than the state average on their municipal government.  Trenton spends 18% less of their property taxes than the state average on schools but spends an enormous 387% more than the state average on their municipal government.  In Paterson, 49% less on schools; 251% more on their city government.  East Orange, 39% less on schools; 379% more on city government.  It is outrageous.  It is unacceptable.  But it is perfectly predictable.

If you require the state to pay the overwhelming percentage of the school costs in these 31 districts, they are left with the choice:  do we tax less or just spend more on the growth of government?  The answer is resounding in most of the 31 SDA districts--the people of the rest of the state pay over 80% of the costs of our schools and we will spend our money to build oversized municipal governments--with no relief for local or state taxpayers.  The abuses abound.  Take Trenton for example.  The Presidents of both the PBA and AFSCME locals receive full municipal pay to work only for the unions.  No time working for the people; only for the unions.  No wonder it costs so much.

How do we fix these problems? First, we must fix the tax problem because that is the one that affects each and every New Jerseyan and threatens the future of the affordability of our state.  I propose we do this by changing the school funding formula.  I propose the Fairness Formula; equal funding for every child in New Jersey.

Every child has potential.  Every child has goals.  Every child has dreams.  No child's dreams are less worthy than any others.  No child deserves less funding from the state's taxpayers.  That goal must be reached, especially after watching the last 30 years of failed governmental engineering which has failed families in the 31 SDA districts and taxpayers all across New Jersey.

What would the effect of this change be for school aid in New Jersey?  75% of all New Jersey would get more state aid under the Fairness Formula.  That is how fundamentally unfair the current formula is to students and taxpayers.  And it is unfair in every part of this state.

In Margate, they would receive 428% more in aid.  In Fairlawn, 815% more in aid. In that town, when combined with our 2% property tax cap, this new aid would result in average drop in their school property tax of over 2,200 per household.  In Teaneck, 389% more in aid and an average drop in property taxes of nearly $1,600.  In Wood-Ridge, an 801% increase in aid and a drop in property taxes of over $1,800.  How about South Jersey?  In Cherry Hill, an increase in aid of 411% and a drop in property taxes of over $1,700.  In Haddonfield, an increase in aid of 1705% and a drop in property taxes of nearly $3,600.

The pattern is repeated everywhere.  South Orange aid up 912%, taxes down over $3,700. In Readington Township, aid up 410%, taxes down nearly $2,000. In Robbinsville, aid up 666%, taxes down over $2,600.  In Freehold Township, aid up 153%, taxes down over $1,500. In Chatham Township, aid up 1271%, taxes down $3,800.  In Wayne, aid up 1181%, taxes down over $2,100.  All over the state, we slay the dragon of property taxes by implementing the Fairness Formula.  For the first time in anyone's memory, property taxes plummeting not rising.  And all through valuing each child and their hopes, dreams and potential the same.

Of course, we will make sure that we have the aid for special needs students so that they may reach their potential too.  They are the exception though; the overwhelming majority of students deserve the Fairness Formula and we intend to pursue it for them.
The issue that in every poll that you see for my lifetime has been named by the people of New Jersey as the most important issue: reducing property taxes. The 2% cap has restrained property taxes and if we pass this school funding formula, you will see why the 2% cap is so important because if you give them all this money, believe me they'll want to spend it. But with a 2% cap they'll only be able to spend 2% of the new money they get. The 98% has to go back to you, where it came from, in the first place. And I suspect, that when we stop encouraging the idea that money equals achievement and when we start supporting the methods put in place by these charter schools in urban areas that are showing such extraordinary achievement at a fraction of the cost, that we can fix the urban education problem at the same time. Necessity is the mother of invention everybody. If we give everybody $33,000 a year to graduate 66% of their students they're just going to keep doing it. If you tell them that the charter school down the street graduates 89% of their students with half the money- maybe they might want to wander down the street and see how they're doing it. And maybe we could break the special interests of the state on the old orthodox. It's up to us. I'm going to be the voice for this and I welcome as many people to this cause as are willing to join me. 75% of the districts in the state do better, it's time for your voices to be heard. It's been 30 years of a failed social experiment by a group of lawyers in black robes. It's time for the people to take control back of this issue and apply common sense to it. Every child in this state deserves to be treated equally. And every child in this state deserves an education that prepares them for the job or the education that they want to pursue. We're failing on both fronts and it's an unacceptable failure because we see the solution in front of us because we just choose not to do it because we don't have the will. I have the will. And I think you do too.
We want to see major changes to the failed model of education in so many of these 31 SDA districts.  We now see definitively that money has not made the difference over these 30 years but reforms have made the difference.  We will continue to advocate for those reforms and we will insist that this new funding formula reward our successful charter schools with funding that comports with their success.

It is fundamentally wrong that students in the SDA districts receive 5 times more in state aid than students in non-SDA districts; it is unfair to those students and unfair to the residents of those towns who have been forced for more than three decades to foot the cost of that failure and unfairness.

A funding formula that puts a higher value on one child over another is morally wrong and it has been economically destructive.  We cannot let it continue.

I will travel across the state this summer to talk about this plan to, for the first time in my lifetime, lower property taxes for the people of New Jersey and bring fairness to the funding of our schools.

We can do better and we must--in educating all of our children and in bringing fairness to our taxpayers.  No one should be denied an education because of where they call home--an no one should have to sell their home because they can any longer afford the property taxes caused by a perverse school funding formula that devalues their children in the eyes of the state budget.  After all, it is their tax dollars that, in part, fund that aid itself.

I have 18 months left in office and I will not permit these fundamental truths to not be spoken and acted upon.  I will demand that the Legislature try defend the indefensible--that one child is worth more than another in the eyes of the state depending upon their zip code; or they can come along with me to fix this issue and put an end to the misery of our property taxpayers and make history in New Jersey.  I am ready for the fight and I know the taxpayers of New Jersey are looking for us to finally solve this problem.

Thank you for your attention and, now, lets get to work.",,,07/08/16 11:15 AM
111064,1106072,Governor Christie: No Child Is Worth More Than Another,06/21/16,1,"No child in this state is worth more state aid than another. No family in this state should have to disproportionately pay- you've got a bigger house, you're going to pay more in property taxes, you've got more land, you're going to pay more in property taxes- that's not what I'm talking about. We're talking about 52% of your property taxes going to schools in 546 districts and 26% of your property taxes going to schools in 31 districts. We're talking about 546 districts having to divide $88 billion over the last thirty years and 31 districts diving $97 billion. Where did the money go? And what did you get in return for it? But an even more important question than what did you get in return for it- what did those children and their families get in return for it? Underachieving schools that do not prepare them for the jobs of the future or the careers and college life of the future. We are paying a king's ransom in those 546 districts but in most of them, we are preparing our students for the future. We now should share with each other the money that our state taxes. It can be fixed. We don't have to rely upon the courts to do it.",,,07/08/16 11:22 AM

111064,1106115,Governor Christie On School Funding: We Have A Way To Fix This And Lower Your Property Taxes,06/28/16,1,"The people in this state are being driven from this state because of high property taxes. We know that. We also know that children across the state, especially in those 31 districts, are being driven from a productive, happy, successful future by a failed education system. Neither one of those things are acceptable to me. So now you know the governor has put forward what is now called a ""radical' school funding plan. ""Radical.' This ""radical' idea that everyone should be treated the same, and not like I just came up with it out of thin air. We've had 30 years of treating people differently, and we've had nothing but failure for it and driving people from their homes because their property taxes go up and up and up. Listen, any problem that's been around for this long is hard to fix. And it means that there is going to be some people who get more and some people who get less. I don't have a magic wand, everybody -- where I am going to make everybody happy and I'm going to fix every problem and it is not going to make anybody upset. I think you all learned about me a long time ago that there are some things I'm concerned about, and making people upset isn't one of them. I'm the governor of New Jersey for God's sake. We are perpetually upset, right? So we have got to have this conversation, it's uncomfortable, it's uncomfortable. But here is the thing, I walked in today, and I got a bunch of people protesting outside. That's how I knew I was home. And they're from the Teacher's Union, and they protest this. Why? Why? Now, I could tell you I could understand it if I was cutting funding to schools. Well they would say, ""We work at schools, that means there'll be less money for schools, which means there'll be less money for us and we're against that.' I completely understand that. They are defending a failed system. How can you defend a 66% graduation rate in Asbury Park at $33,000 (per student) a year. How do you defend it? It's impossible to defend it. Forget about from a taxpayer perspective, we know we're getting shafted here. How do you defend it for those kids and their families? How do you say that's good enough? I had some newspaper columnist write this week, ""Well it's better than some other states do.' I'm like yeah, dude, send your kids there. I don't know.  They're not sending their kids to Asbury Park. Not sending their kids to Asbury Park. We have to think this way: that every child in this state is our child. We're paying enough for them, it's almost like we are. Every child in this state is our child. And for your own child, if they were in a school with a 66 percent graduation rate and you had any way of getting them out and getting them some place better you'd get them out. We have a way to fix this and to lower your taxes at the same time. It's not a bad deal. It's going to mean breaking some china, it's going to mean making some people uncomfortable. Well, I'd rather have people uncomfortable than have them failed. I'd rather have people uncomfortable than to waste the potential of children.",,,07/08/16 11:46 AM
111064,1106157,Governor Christie: Charter Schools Are Making A Difference In The Lives Of Children And Families,06/30/16,1,"Charter schools have been in existence for 20 years now. They've proven they work and so we've got to give them more freedom to be more aggressive, and that's why I changed all these rules. And I want you to remember one thing on the way out the door, when I announced those rules, it seems to be pretty commonsense right, you know if you've got an empty building you should be able to occupy it, if you got space in a building that you're not using, why not let a charter school collocate there, and if you want to sign a lease that's longer than your charter, you should be able to do that so you can get a lower price. Within one hour of when I went to the Charter School Association meeting in Atlantic City and announced these new rules, within one hour, the teacher's union came out and opposed it. And what they said in their press release was, this is just an expansion of Governor Christie's failed charter school experiment. Now let me tell you something everybody, I look around this table, they want to say you're part of a failed charter school experiment. All I've heard this morning are testimonies about this school and what a difference it's made in the lives of the children and the families that its affected. If that's failure, we should have more failure all over this state.",,,07/08/16 12:02 PM
