26344,1095092,Speaker Ryan Talks Defeating Terrorism on The O'Reilly Factor,06/16/16,3,"Last night, Speaker Ryan appeared on Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor to discuss how the House is working to prevent more tragic terrorist attacks like that in Orlando. But, as Speaker Ryan pointed out, it's important to stick to our principles while doing so--principles that, for example, support a security test for those trying to enter the U.S.:

""We believe in the First Amendment, which is freedom of religion. So I really do think a security test--that's what we passed here in the House. We said you can't have the Syrian refugee program until you have a security test where you can properly vet every single person--and we have passed that bill. . . . We passed a bill stopping [the refugee program], but based on not religion--based on security. And we don't have the kind of assurances we want to be secure about this. And that's why I call this a security test. Because it's not saying--look, anybody can come and say they are this or that. If they declare their religion to get into the United States, that doesn't really do much, does it? We need a security test.""

Another big question is--should we declare war on ISIS? The speaker thinks the answer is a resounding yes--but in a way that doesn't tie the hands of the next president:

""I think we should declare war on ISIS and every other one of these groups--a fresh authorization of the military force. Here's the problem: President Obama wants to tie the hands of the military. President Obama is saying that he will not accept an authorization of the military force that does not completely hamstring his successor--and we are not going to do that.""

So what will House Republicans do instead? For starters, they'll focus on the national security plank of A Better Way rolled out last week--it features 67 recommendations on how to confront terrorism:

""I would encourage you to go to Better.GOP. Because at Better.GOP, we released a national security strategy last Thursday before Orlando--67 recommendations on exactly what we should be doing to confront Islamic radical terrorism.""

It's a hard battle to fight, but it must be won--and House Republicans are determined to stop this threat once and for all.",,,06/23/16 02:51 PM
34024,1096168,Exclusive interview with Governor Mike Pence on Indiana's new Real Alternatives program,02/16/16,3,"In November 2015, Governor Mike Pence announced that Indiana would move forward with a statewide $3.5 million expansion of a national program called Real Alternatives designed to help abortion-vulnerable women to choose life. Here in an exclusive interview, Governor Pence shares why he believes this program is so vital to the future of Indiana.

Q: Recently you announced a $3.5 million expansion of the Real Alternatives program in Indiana. Tell us about the Real Alternatives program and what services will be offered.

Gov. Pence: Real Alternatives provides financial support and other resources to existing pregnancy centers, adoption agencies, maternity homes, and social service agencies. These organizations provide a wide variety of core services for Hoosiers such as information, education, and counseling that promote childbirth rather than abortion. They also assist pregnant women in their decisions regarding adoption or parenting and provide support services such as baby food, maternity clothes, baby clothes, and referrals for other services that clients may need (such as housing, employment, etc.).

Q: Prior to announcing the expansion, Indiana piloted the Real Alternatives program in the northern part of the state beginning in 2014. What were the results of the pilot program in terms of the number of women served and the number of centers participating?

Gov. Pence: When we launched the one-year Real Alternatives pilot program in northern Indiana, we estimated that 3,000 clients would be served. However, at the close of the pilot program, 8,737 clients had been served through 17,445 visits at 16 different service sitesÂ…",,,06/24/16 09:09 AM
53306,1096556,Interview With Bingru Wang of Phoenix TV,05/31/16,3,"QUESTION: Thank you very much, Secretary Kerry, for being with us today.

SECRETARY KERRY: My pleasure. Thank you.

QUESTION: Let's talk about S&ED. We know every year S&ED covers almost everything of United States and China's relation. This year, what's on top of your agenda?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, we want to talk about the ways in which China and the United States can cooperate and work together on any number of global issues. I mean, we are very powerful economies, powerful countries. Some people want to try to create a sense of tension and clash, but I think it's much more important to be working on the things that we can do to cooperate together and to make a difference.

For instance, we've worked very hard on the Iran nuclear agreement. We were very successful in working together. We worked very hard on climate change. And China was very helpful, instrumental in helping to move to a different place so we could do the agreement in Paris. We've worked very hard on trade issues, on economic issues. On Ebola we worked very closely together. So -- and North Korea is another example.

So there are many places where China and the United States need to cooperate together. We will have differences, but we need to manage those differences in an effective, thoughtful way.

QUESTION: Talking about this mechanism, S&ED, first of all, will this be the last round of S&ED? And how do you think this mechanism contribute to U.S.-China relation or is just talk for the sake of talking?

SECRETARY KERRY: No, it's not -- the S&ED is not talk for the sake of talk, because out of the S&ED came our cooperation on climate change. Out of the S&ED came a better understanding of our mutual interests regarding the nuclear program of the DPRK. And I can go on. There are many things where we've reached better understanding of each other's interests. I hope it will continue, because I think it's very valuable. And I hope -- providing you have the right president, I'm confident that people would see the reason for continuing.

QUESTION: One of the most sensitive issue is South China Sea, especially this year. The international arbitral tribunal is going to announce their result. How are you going to address this issue to your Chinese counterparts? Because for many Chinese, it's very hard to -- Chinese to understand the United States is not even a signatory to the UNCLOS, so how can you ask China to obey the rules while yourself didn't even sign up to it?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, we're a signatory. We haven't ratified it, but we are a signatory. And the United States supports UNCLOS and we live by UNCLOS. Even though we have a Congress that has not yet ratified it, we, the Administration, live by UNCLOS. So we agree to abide by the rules.

Now, international standards encourage countries to resolve differences diplomatically. We encourage China not to engage in unilateral reclamation activities in the South China Sea, unilateral militarization efforts in the South China Sea. And we do the same for the other claimants. No country should be engaged in reclamation unilaterally or in militarization. We encourage China -- and by the way, we take no position on the claim. I can't tell you if China's claim is legitimate or not legitimate or historical or not historical or would stand up in arbitration or not. I don't know.

What I do know, what President Obama knows, is the region will be much safer and much better if whatever differences there are in claims are resolved through either the judicial process, through a legal rule of law process, or by direct negotiation between the parties. And that's what we encourage. We want a diplomatic, appropriate solution that respects rule of law.

QUESTION: Just a quick follow-up on this. But the United States does send warships time to times to the South China Sea to challenge China's sovereignty. You can argue this is for the sake of freedom of navigation, but actions speak louder than words. (Inaudible) send a signal for other parties to interpret your intention.

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, freedom of navigation was -- is simply that. It's not provocative. Unless you have a reason to want to prevent it, it's simply freedom of navigation. And we've been doing that for decades now, for 40 years or more. I mean, this is a longstanding right of exercise of freedom of navigation.

So we've historically always had freedom of navigation exercises. And if you don't have any negative intent, it really shouldn't worry you at all that somebody is doing a freedom of navigation exercise. We have Russia, I think even China has conducted exercises. Russia conducted exercises while President Obama was in Alaska last summer. We didn't get excited about it because people have a right to do a freedom of navigation.

QUESTION: Will you support the Philippine -- president just proposed a bilateral talk with China on South China Sea. Will you support the bilateral talks?

SECRETARY KERRY: Absolutely. We think it's a very good idea.

QUESTION: Not based on the result of the tribunal.

SECRETARY KERRY: No, we think it's a very good idea for -- I welcome the president reaching out. I think it's very good and I hope that it can be constructive.

QUESTION: How about China just also proposed military exercise between China and ASEAN countries.

SECRETARY KERRY: The ASEAN has a right to make a decision about what they want to do with respect to that. Contrary to public opinion, the United States is not sitting around plotting ways to try to block China's increased ability to have an impact. China is a very powerful country. China is rising economically. China will one day be the biggest economy in the world. Why? Because it's the biggest country in the world in terms of people, population. That's okay. That's fine. We're not worried about that because we know that what matters to us is the integrity and the strength of our own economy, so that our own citizens are able to work and our own citizens are doing better. And each country will obviously place the welfare of its own citizens at the highest place, and we understand that.

But we're not trying to contain China. I say this again and again. We do not sit around and wonder about what China is doing in Asia or in Southeast Asia or in Africa or -- we don't -- this is fine. We're everywhere. A lot of countries are everywhere. And that's the way the world is today.

QUESTION: Secretary Kerry, you have achieved tremendously in the past three years -- you just mentioned the climate agreement and Iran deal. But when it comes to North Korea, why the North Korea policy is not as much successful? Is there anything the United States can do more, or are you going to leave this difficult issue to the next administration?

SECRETARY KERRY: No, we're constantly working on North Korea. In fact, we have meetings on it this very week before I come to China.

We believe that China has the greatest ability to have an impact on North Korea. Everybody knows that. China is their next-door neighbor. China is the route through which all of the commerce of North Korea really passes. China's banking goes through Beijing. China provides food aid to North Korea. China does trading with North Korea. Obviously, China puts enormous amount of gas supplies into North Korea. So China is North Korea's lifeline, not the United States, not Russia, not Korea, not Japan -- South Korea. So in the end, China is the country that has the greatest single ability to have an impact on Kim Jong-un's thinking and on North Korea as a whole. And we are not asking China to do the impossible or to do the unreasonable, but we do believe that all of us could do a little more than we are doing today, including the United States. And we are looking at different things that we could do that could have greater impact also.

QUESTION: So what can the United States do more?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, there are ways in which the United States can have an impact in terms of our own defense in order to protect ourselves. There are ways the United States can have an impact on unilateral sanctions or on getting other countries to be stronger in applying their sanctions to North Korea so that it has a greater impact on North Korea's decision making.

QUESTION: Thank you very much, Secretary Kerry.

SECRETARY KERRY: My pleasure. Thank you very much.",,,06/24/16 11:53 AM
53306,1096568,Facebook Live Interview With Sean Lesniak for Discovery Channel,06/01/16,3,"QUESTION: Hi. My name is Sean Lesniak, and I'm here with Secretary John Kerry to interview him about sharks. Would you like to say hi to the fans?

SECRETARY KERRY: Hi, guys. I'm John Kerry, and I'm here with Sean, looking forward to a conversation about sharks.

QUESTION: Now, let's get down to business. I love sharks. How did you get interested in sharks and the ocean?

SECRETARY KERRY: I think I got interested when I first got scared as a kid. But I've always been interested in all of the ocean life, and sharks are obviously a big part of it.

QUESTION: All right. From Twitter, Sideways101 asked, ""What can we do about plastic in our ocean?""

SECRETARY KERRY: You've got to keep it from going in the ocean in the first place, and we've got to clean up the plastic that is there. There -- what's amazing is the amount of plastic, and it's very, very damaging, as you know, to marine species, because they ingest it -- birds ingest it. And it's very, very -- it kills. So last year they had a cleanup globally. About 800,000 young people came out and helped clean up the ocean or the beaches around the ocean, and they came up with the equivalent of 100 737s' worth of -- Boeing 737s' worth of trash out of the ocean, of plastic, which is obviously a stunning amount of tonnage. There are places in the ocean -- I'm sure you know this -- whether there's just a swirl of huge amount of garbage, plastic.

So we need to pick it up. We've got to clean it out of the ocean; we've got to keep it from going into the ocean. We have to have an awareness of this in ocean communities around the world, water communities, estuaries, bays, rivers -- anywhere where it can flow out and become a hazard, become a weapon that kills marine life.

QUESTION: All right. So number three, can you introduce me to President Barack Obama so he can he can help me to stop the shark fin trade?

SECRETARY KERRY: (Laughter.) Can I? Yeah, I can. Will I? I don't know. I've got to figure this out. If you treat me well, Sean, maybe we can cut a deal here. We'll see what happens.

QUESTION: All right. Laura --

SECRETARY KERRY: I think he'd love to meet you. I think you've got a lot going, obviously, and he'd be interested in your conservation efforts.

QUESTION: Laura R. is asking, ""What are other solutions to help our oceans' health?""

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, there are a lot of other solutions. We can have better agriculture practices where we don't have as much nitrate flowing off of farmland into the waters, carried out into -- for instance, through the Mississippi River, the Gulf, where you have a 5,000-square-mile dead zone. Or in the Chesapeake right nearby here, you've got pfiesteria and huge algae bloom that occurs because the nitrate overload kills the oxygen, which kills the plant life, and then you have a problem. So -- and fish die because their spawning grounds or their food disappears. So we need to stop the overload of trash and fuel and muck, and particularly the nitrates that flow into all of our water bodies. That's one thing we can do.

We obviously need to be more cognizant of fishing practices and prevent illegal fishing in order to save the oceans and preserve life in a sustainable fishery. And getting people to have enforcement measures that prevent too many fish from being taken out of one particular stock, which is not sustainable, is critical to all of us.

QUESTION: All right. So I have this one, which is my favorite: Who are you rooting for in the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Sharks or the Penguins?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, I know who you're rooting for, but I'm rooting for the Penguins, because the Penguins, you see, are in the same league as the Boston Bruins, and the Bruins didn't make it. So I have to be loyal to my league. And the penguins are kind of at a disadvantage to a shark, don't you think?

QUESTION: Yeah, but -- yeah, true, but they've already won a championship, and the Sharks haven't won one yet. I think it's fair for the Penguins to share some of the glory with the Sharks too.

SECRETARY KERRY: Think so?

QUESTION: Yeah.

SECRETARY KERRY: This -- I think this is the year of the penguin. (Laughter.) Let's see what happens.

QUESTION: All right. All right, I have some other questions. All right. How is the climate change affecting our oceans and sharks?

SECRETARY KERRY: Climate change is having a very negative impact on the oceans because the acidity, which comes out of CO2 that dumps into the ocean or is stored in the ocean, turns into carbonic acid. And that carbonic acid has a very negative effect on particularly crustacean marine life, and also on coral reefs, which are critical. About half the coral reef of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia is dead as a result of what has happened through coral bleaching, which occurs because of the acidification. So there's a profound negative impact on marine life -- on the habitat, on the ecosystem as a system.

We don't know all of the impacts. We still are learning about what happens. But we do know that, for instance, clams grow at a lesser or greater degree depending on how much acidity is in the water in that particular place. So we see an impact very directly. We know also that certain other marine life is negatively affected by the acidification.

You also have a warming that's taking place, so it's not just the acidity side. You have a warming that's taking place. That warming means a migration of certain kinds of fish from colder to warmer or warmer to colder, and you have the melting of ice that's taking place which is exposing a whole new set of areas to commercial fishing that hadn't been exposed. And unless that is managed properly, it could have a profound impact, negative impact on the overall balance of the ecosystem as a whole.

QUESTION: What is your favorite shark and why?

SECRETARY KERRY: My favorite shark is one that everybody can feel comfortable being in the water around, like a basking shark or a sand shark. I think just because people don't have a pure understanding of what sharks may or may not do, that's the easiest one to manage.

QUESTION: Have you ever swam or gone diving with sharks?

SECRETARY KERRY: Sure, absolutely. I've been diving and I've watched a shark asleep on the -- in a cave on the ocean floor.

QUESTION: Tonic immobility?

SECRETARY KERRY: Yeah. It's kind of cool. And swimming around a shark that you know is not going to tear you apart is a lot more fun than being nervous. I'm not exactly anxious to meet a great white shark while I'm in the water.

QUESTION: That's all the questions we have.",,,06/24/16 11:58 AM

PARTICIPANT: Let me check this.

SECRETARY KERRY: I can do what?

PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible.)

SECRETARY KERRY: Okay. (Laughter.) We're not always -- we don't always start that confused, I promise you.

It is a great, great pleasure for me to be able to be here with all of you this morning. And I had a chance to meet your extraordinary Science Bowl champions, who I think are pretty amazing and I'm sure you think so too. And how many of you -- do you know the last question that was answered, any of you? Let me try this on you.

Material A has a bulk modulus that is twice the bulk modulus of Material B. If both A and B have the same densities, by what factor must the speed of sound in B be multiplied to find the speed of sound in A? You all get that, right? Everybody's got that, right? I barely knew what the question meant, let alone the answer, but it's by a factor of 2, correct? Where are you? Who got that?

PARTICIPANT: Yeah, those were 2.

SECRETARY KERRY: And you got that answer. I think he deserves an amazing -- (applause). And one of the two seniors who are leaving is going off to Princeton and the other is going to MIT, so a huge congratulations to you and to your coach. Where is the coach over here? He's done an amazing job.

MS JOHNSON: Yeah, back there.

SECRETARY KERRY: Back there, he's hiding back there. Coach, thank you. Great job, really amazing. (Applause.) And then there's the Ocean Bowl crew. Anybody here who was in the Ocean Bowl? Any of you? You were, okay. And a bunch of you from the same team.

AUDIENCE: Yeah.

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, congratulations to you. They won the regionals and then they devoted their attention, obviously, to the Science Bowl rather than the Ocean Bowl.

So as Secretary of State, it's really a privilege for me to be able to come here and just share a few thoughts with you, and I want to get you all engaged in a conversation. So I'm not going to talk at you for very long at all. I'd rather take questions and we can have a real discussion.

But I'm sure you're saying to yourself, ""Okay, why is the Secretary of State of the United States of America, in an age where we have terrorism and we have several wars going on at the same time -- why are we focused on the oceans, and what does that have to do with my life every single day?"" Well, the fact is that the oceans are essential to your life. Life on Earth wouldn't exist without the oceans because half the oxygen that we get that we breathe is produced through the oceans. In addition to that, a massive amount of food that the world consumes, a huge amount of protein in countries all over the world, it's a huge part of the economies of countries to produce the food that comes from the ocean.

And in addition to that, it is absolutely critical to the weather that we live with. The oceans are a critical -- like a thermostat, if you will, cranking up and cranking down whatever happens with respect to the weather and the climate. So we're spending billions of dollars today of taxpayer money. Your parents' money is going to pay for the harder impact of storms that we're suffering -- much more damage than ever before as a result of the intensity of the storms that we suffer because of climate change.

We're seeing rainstorms that are much more intense than ever before. Houston, Texas had a rainstorm the other day that produced 17 inches of rain within a few hours -- more rain than it had produced in the entire rainfall of the summer a year ago. This last April was the hottest April in all of recorded history. But what's scary is that every month before it in the last year now ranks as the hottest particular month in recorded history. So, April, the hottest recorded April; March, the hottest recorded March; February, the hottest recorded February; and so forth, all the way back through the year. But then it gets even more dramatic, because last year was the hottest year in recorded history, and that was the hottest year in the hottest decade in recorded history. And guess what? The decade before that was the -- is now the second-hottest decade in history, and the decade before that is the third-hottest decade in history. So does that begin to tell you something? It should. That's a warning signal about as loud as any warning signal you could get.

And the problem is that global climate change -- which comes about because of the CO2 and other greenhouse gases that we put in the atmosphere -- global climate change is having a profound negative impact on our oceans, because the CO2 that falls out of the sky in the rainfall and goes into the ocean turns into carbonic acid, and that carbonic acid in the ocean has a negative impact on fisheries, on shell-backed life in the ocean, marine-backed. So, lobsters or crabs or shellfish are negatively impacted by the acidification. And you can see experiments that have been done that show you clams that are put into different levels of acidity, and depending on the level of acidity, the clams are smaller and smaller and smaller -- greater acidity, smaller clam. Ultimately, it has the ability to actually destroy the ability of some of these living life to be able to produce the shells that they live in. So it destroys habitat, it destroys ecosystem.

So what we're seeing, also, is obviously several other challenges with the oceans. It's not just acidification. We have a problem with what's called ""non-source point pollution[1]"", particularly in areas where there's a lot of farming, because you have high levels of fertilizer, and the fertilizer has high level of nitrates, and nitrates pour into a bay, like the Chesapeake Bay, where we've had major algae boom -- bloom as a result of the nitrate overgrowth, and it crowds out the oxygen, which in the end reproduces the algae bloom, which crowds out fish and you have a dead zone in the end. We have 166 dead zones in the United States. The largest dead zone of all is about 5,000 square miles down by the Gulf of -- in the Gulf of Mexico, out where the Mississippi River comes out because you have 31 states pouring nitrates off of farmland, a rainstorm pours into the rivers, rivers into the larger rivers and down into the Mississippi from the Missouri, and we get a dead zone.

There are now over 400 dead zones on a global basis and they've gone up every single decade for the last decades. What does that tell you? It tells you that we're not solving the problem; it's getting worse, not better.

In addition to the dead zone challenge and nitrate overload, we have plastic pollution. Last year, on one single day globally, about 800,000 people -- most of them young people -- got together to do a cleanup on a global basis of the oceans, of the plastic on the beaches and plastic that's in the streets near the beaches that can be washed out into the sea. And they got about 100 737s' equivalent of plastic that they took out of the ocean. Now, the problem with the plastic is -- and there are parts of the ocean where there are huge -- I mean, literally kilometers-wide areas where these mass of junk that has been collected from the tides and the currents of the world that gathers in these several places -- you can just visibly see it if you flew over it in an airplane, a mass of plastic junk. But this plastic breaks down over time and marine mammals ingest it. They eat it. And they can die from it. You have an enormous amount of plastic in the ocean that is affecting marine mammals and birds, various -- porpoise or other things -- and the result is that we're again having a profoundly negative impact on the ecosystem of the oceans.

Bottom line is, folks, we rely on the oceans on this planet for life itself, particularly because of the oxygen cycle. We also know that the oceans consume about 25 percent of the global emissions that we put up into the atmosphere that are contributing to climate change. Much of that is consumed and stored in the ocean. The problem is scientists can't really tell you how much the ocean can actually hold, how long it can hold it. So if all of a sudden the ocean started to regurgitate that CO2, then you have a massive overload of CO2 that is already negatively impacting the temperatures that we're living with on Earth.

So you can see, and all of you don't need me to tell you about it, because you're smarter than I am and you know the connections of these dots and the impact that it has potentially on our lives, on fisheries in the future.

There's one other problem, very quickly, and then I'll open it up. It's illegal, unregulated, unreported fishing. We have billions of dollars' worth of illegal fishery business being done in the world. Out of there, there are about 17 regional fishery management structures in the world. And out of those 17, about a third of them are fully overfished already. Every one of the rest of them are at maximum level of fishing capacity. So as the population grows and as more and more pressure is put on our fisheries, we're going to have a huge challenge just to maintain the stocks in a sustainable way. And if we don't keep stocks sustainable, food -- a huge food resource for the planet disappears, not to mention an ecosystem that gets destroyed.

I represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate for about 28 years, and I was chairman of the fisheries subcommittee at one point in time. And we had to literally stop the fishing of striped bass in Massachusetts for 10 years in order to let the stock replenish. That is, in fact, a challenge now with fisheries all over the world. We -- it's called Cape Cod, but we don't have cod that are fished that much up there anymore. Can't find them. And there's been a migration of fish because of the warming of the ocean. You now have fish swimming -- by the way, we have great white sharks off of parts of Massachusetts now because they're coming after the seal population, and there's been a whole shift and migration of certain kinds of fish to certain places because the waters are getting warmer.

So this -- I came here today because we have announced a major conference to be held in Washington. It's the third one we're doing since I've been Secretary. And it is a global conference we will have right here in Washington on the 15th and 16th of September at the State Department, bringing people from all over the world to talk about how we are going to manage this together. How do we deal with these challenges, and what are we going to do to make sure that your generation inherits an ocean that we all grew up with learning how to appreciate and love? And it's important, obviously, for the long-term future of this planet for us to deal with and understand the crisis of the ocean as it is linked to the challenge of climate change, as it is linked to the quality of life that we have here on Earth itself.

So that's why I'm here today, to put an exclamation point on the extraordinary work of your science bowl finalists and victors, your champions, which is a great tribute to this school, this amazing school you all go to. And I'm in awe of what you have accomplished. Out of 69 schools that competed, representing all 50 states, you came out number one -- the champion. And it's a great credit to all of you.

So with that, let me open it up and let's just have a discussion. And I'm happy to answer any questions that anybody has on any topic. It doesn't have to be on the ocean, though I would love it if it were. (Laughter.) So who wants to go first? We got somebody lined up here?

PARTICIPANT: Yeah.

SECRETARY KERRY: Who's that? Right here?

PARTICIPANT: Go ahead.

SECRETARY KERRY: Yes, please. Tell us your name.

QUESTION: My name is (inaudible). And I have a question that in what status would the ocean be in 100 years if humans continue to do what -- the damage they're doing to the ocean right now?

SECRETARY KERRY: So I'll repeat the question: What -- in what status would the ocean be if humans continue to do the damage that they are doing to it today? Well, I can't tell you with absolute precision, but I can tell you that scientists are predicting that if we continue with the ice melt that we're seeing in the Arctic and Antarctic, and particularly if the Greenland ice sheet were to melt -- and the reason the Greenland ice sheet is different, the ice sheet in the Arctic is floating, so it's already displacing water but -- and therefore, as it melts it's not a straight addition to the water volume of the ocean. But on Greenland, it's sitting on rock. And you can go up to Greenland today and there's a huge hole that you can see in the summertime and there's a torrent of a river running underneath the Greenland ice sheet, and some scientists are asking whether or not whole blocks of ice may just break off under that torrent and slide down into the ocean. The melt is at a ferocious rate. The Northwest Passage will be open over the course of the next 10, 15, 20 years during the summertime. And the more the ocean is exposed, the more the ice melts, the more you have a white reflective substance -- the snow and ice -- that makes the heat bounce back up into the atmosphere. Instead, you have a dark ocean and the dark ocean consumes the heat and it gets hotter. So your progression goes faster as a result of that in terms of the melting.

So we are seeing predictions of anywhere from three to six feet, and over a course of time, end of century into the next century, unpredictable levels well more than that conceivably, because if the Antarctic ice sheet continues at the rate that it's going, we're going to have a serious, serious challenge. Already we have refugees in this world as a result of the rise of ocean levels, particularly in the Pacific islands. There are island states where their leaders are talking about where they're going to move to -- a whole nation-state -- and where they're going to go live. So there are huge challenges as a result.

So I can't predict completely. What I can tell you is there's a good thing that's happened. We went to Paris last December and we negotiated -- President Obama made this a big priority of his Administration and he's pushed a national action plan on reduction of our emissions level. We're already 10 percent of the way down the road. I think we've got about -- is it 10 percent? Yeah -- of our emissions level that are targeted out of 17 percent that we're trying to achieve by 2020, and 26 to 28 percent by 2025. So if we keep doing that, and other nations keep doing that, we have a chance to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change. We're not yet on a path to guarantee that we keep the Earth's temperature at 2 degrees centigrade of increase, which many scientists have suggested is the tipping point. If you go beyond the 2 degrees, you begin to have negative impacts that are unpredictable to some degree.

So I can't give -- I can tell you that the power to solve this problem is in our hands. The solution to climate change is very simple -- energy policy. As long as we are continuing to provide the energy for our vehicles or the energy for our heating of our plants or the lights that are on in this room -- if it all comes from the burning of fossil fuels, we're in trouble. But if we can transition to clean, alternative, renewable energy, and begin to minimize the quotient of the fossil fuels that are really negative, we have a chance of avoiding the worst impacts. That's why this is so urgent, and that's why I'm here today. Because we're trying to raise people's consciousness about just how serious this challenge really is.

Next question. Yes, sir.

QUESTION: My name's Sam. So fish stocks are under dire threat from overfishing and climate change. What concrete actions are the U.S. taking to protect global fisheries from these threats?

SECRETARY KERRY: Good question, because I raised the problem; I didn't give you an answer to what we might do about it. Basically, you have too much money chasing too few fish. And when you have a lot of money involved, you almost always have challenges of enforcement, of transparency, of regulation if you will. What you have are some criminal enterprises that are out there avoiding responsibility for sustainable fisheries, avoiding responsibility for good working conditions for fishing people, who exploit and exploit and exploit -- they exploit at every stage. They exploit the worker, they exploit the process, they exploit the ocean, and then they come back and they exploit the lack of enforcement mechanisms, and they sell the fish and take the money and run. The problem is the ocean can't sustain that.

So what we are doing is working with many other nations now to raise the level of enforcement. And we have a new program called Sea Scout that we will be implementing through this conference that we are having where we are bringing NASA and satellite surveillance, and we are bringing the military and coast guards and all of our police and law enforcement community and governments all together to talk about how we can put some monitoring and some enforcement into the ungoverned spaces of the ocean.

The ocean is so vast that you have huge parts of it that don't belong to any particular nation. They're outside of what we call the extended economic zone of a country -- about 200 miles. So everything outside of there begins to be what we call the high seas. And we need an enforcement mechanism for the high seas, so we are going to be laying out how we do this with monitors on boats. We have ways that we work dual permission with another country where someone from our country in the Coast Guard will ride on the ship of another country to help them know how to enforce, and we share responsibilities. There are a lot of things that we're trying to put together that will empower us to be able to enforce. We have a new thing called the port state measures, which is -- the ports of our world are a place where normally people come to land the fish. If those places will only take fish that they know are caught by a licensed captain and that are legally caught in places where it is permissible, then you have an enforcement mechanism for the distribution of the fish. And that's a way that we can begin to get control over this.

So we're doing everything we can now to raise awareness, increase cooperation, and begin to put enforcement in place. That's the key.

A couple more. A couple more questions. Yes. Yeah.

QUESTION: My name is Cristal. My question is: We know that a lot of action can be done to save the ocean. I want to know, what did you guys already try to save it? And then if the public -- I mean, how the public can be part of it, and also how does you educate the public to, like, to save the oceans?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, we're educating the public, I hope, right now. Turn around, you see these guys? Hopefully the people who are here to write or to tell the story through video will help people to understand what is going on. I mean, in Maryland and Virginia, Washington, we have a pretty good sense of some of this because of the history of the Chesapeake Bay, which has had some real problems and there's a massive citizen's organization that has grown up to try to help make sure we're saving it. What we need to do now is extend that kind of citizen action to the rest of the world.

Now, let's be honest. In some places in the world people don't get up out of bed -- if they have a bed to sleep in -- or off the ground or out of their tent and worry about how they're going to save the ocean. They're worried about how they're going to save themselves. And so there are daily challenges to how much you can ask certain places and certain people to do. But certainly we can raise awareness with governments around the world and begin to provide mechanisms that they can employ in order to do this.

I'll give you an example. I mentioned 800,000 young people went out and cleaned up in one single day. There isn't one of you here who couldn't organize that. And you could get a whole bunch of classmates and folks at the school; you could make it a project. You could work with other schools in the community or broader community, in the state, and say, ""We're going to do a national awareness; we're going to do a state awareness. We're going to have a cleanup day on the beaches this summer."" When you go to the beach and enjoy -- if you get a chance to be able to do that, make sure that people aren't just throwing their plastic wrappers away or leaving junk on the beach and so forth. There are all kinds of things that people can do. And it's just a constant process of raising awareness. Eat -- use recyclable things.

Let me give you an example. Fish nets -- in Chile, there's a company down there called -- I think it's called Bureo or something -- in Chile that young people, young entrepreneurs, have put this company together, and they take old fishing nets -- and fishing nets nowadays are not rope; they're monofilament, they're plastic basically -- and they take the fishing nets and they recycle them, and they use them to make clothing or to make skateboards. In this case they're making skateboards out of this recycled plastic.

So there are all kinds of ways to be creative and use something that's already there, that's been processed, and reprocess it rather than just cluttering up the ocean and killing ocean life with it. Those are some of the choices that you can make and the kinds of things that people can do. And it's only limited by your own imagination.

Another question somewhere? Way over --

PARTICIPANT: Laura.

SECRETARY KERRY: Laura. Okay. Oh, we got all the questioners here in the inner -- I finally caught on. Okay.

QUESTION: I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about why the U.S. has failed to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the third version from 1982, especially because it seems to have a lot of widespread global support --

SECRETARY KERRY: It does.

QUESTION: -- and support within this community as well.

SECRETARY KERRY: Good for you. Good for you. How'd you know that?

QUESTION: Well, I did Ocean Science Bowl and I'm interested in marine biology, but I'm also interested in ocean policy, so --

SECRETARY KERRY: That's outstanding. Good for you. Well, that's great. She's absolutely correct. We have an international agreement -- a treaty, a convention. And this international treaty was actually instigated by the United States of America. We were one of the key organizers in helping to get people to come to the table and negotiate this treaty. I believe it was under George Herbert Walker Bush. Is that right? Can you correct me? Or was it Reagan? It was Reagan.

PARTICIPANT: It was Reagan.

SECRETARY KERRY: It was Ronald Reagan. It was actually under Ronald Reagan. I knew it was under a Republican president. And Ronald Reagan actually helped negotiate it, and they saved a seat for us on the advisory board for this for our ratification of it. It is a set of rules and understandings, principles, by which all the nations who sign up to it agree to live in order to manage the oceans effectively with respect to navigation and commercial use, freedom of navigation, all those kinds of issues.

So here we are -- Ronald Reagan was 1980 to 1988 -- and we still have not ratified this. The United States Senate has not ratified it. We tried one year, when I was there and I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, we tried to get it ratified. We just couldn't get enough votes. We fell slightly shy. And the reason that we can't get it ratified is there are some people who ideologically simply are against any treaty, or they believe -- they find a reason to say that this particular treaty would be giving up the sovereignty of the United States of America. Well, it doesn't. It doesn't give up our sovereignty. It doesn't do anything negative in that way. It would actually empower us to be able to protect ourselves, and so we're sort of stuck politically and that's why it hasn't happened.

My hope is that we will break through that. I'm obviously -- I'm not involved in politics day to day right now, but my hope is that we'll break the fever with this election in the fall and start to do these things that we ought to be doing as a matter of our leadership role in the world. And since we're the ones who started this process, we really ought to try to make sure that we're living up to the standard.

Now, this Administration -- the Obama Administration has announced long ago that we will live by all of the requirements of UNCLOS. So even though we're not yet ratified, we are signed up and we live by the rules. And I hope we will continue to do that until the day comes that we ratify it. Okay?

MS JOHNSON: All right.

SECRETARY KERRY: Is that it? That's all we have time for.

MS JOHNSON: Students, let's give Secretary Kerry a round of applause. (Applause.)

SECRETARY KERRY: Can I just -- can I just explain what we're -- I'm going to leave my expert team here. I've got a group of people who are outstanding regarding fisheries: Cathy Novelli, who's the under secretary of state, including all the issues of fisheries, and Dr. Marcia McNutt is here and she is the newly-elected president of the National Academy of Sciences and used to be the head of the U.S. Geological Survey. So you have top-level experts to grill when I duck out of here and escape the clutches of a whole bunch of people who probably know more about the ocean than I do, so thank you. (Laughter.)

MS JOHNSON: Again, thank you Secretary Kerry --

SECRETARY KERRY: Thank you very much.

MS JOHNSON: -- for answering the tough questions and being here today.

SECRETARY KERRY: My pleasure. Thank you.

MS JOHNSON: Thank you very much.

SECRETARY KERRY: Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thanks. (Applause.) Thanks, guys. Congratulations to you. Thank you. All right, thanks. Thank you -- pleasure. Thank you.",,,06/24/16 12:22 PM
53306,1096800,Remarks at Roundtable With Traveling Press,06/03/16,3,"MR KIRBY: Because it's been such a long day for everybody, the Secretary doesn't have any kind of opening statements or anything for you, but he's got to get going so we're going to do about 10 minutes here, guys. And we do this on the record, and just go ahead and try and start with questions, okay?

Do you want to lead, Brad?

QUESTION: Sure. We haven't had a chance to ask this yet: What's your reaction to Clinton and all her top aides not cooperating with the email review you ordered? Are you disappointed? And then the second part of that question: Would you and your top aides cooperate with any investigations that future secretaries launch, or would you potentially --

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, I'm not going to launch -- I'm not going to get into any hypotheticals because our people have fully complied with all of the requirements and everything that we have in email is on the backup, is --

QUESTION: I meant about anything.

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, obviously, I mean, look, I'm not going to speculating. I don't think we have anything to be concerned about; and if and when something arises, we'll -- I can't imagine, because I think we've been bending over backwards. I am the guy who wrote the letter to the IG to ask for a self-investigation into our own department and asked for all recommendations with respect to how do we make -- improve it, what do we do. Three-quarters of the recommendations they made we had already implemented -- or more. Ninety percent of them we probably implemented before they even made a report. And then we did a couple of other things that were helpful. So I feel very proud of what we have done to be open and accessible and accountable.

QUESTION: What about this past secretary --

SECRETARY KERRY: And we are accountable.

QUESTION: What about her decision? You ordered the review. She didn't cooperate nor did any of her top aides.

SECRETARY KERRY: I am not going to get into commenting on something that involves the presidential race and candidates and prior behavior. There are enough investigations and enough open interrogations going on that the -- it just seems to me it's sort of been overdone in so many ways, and we'll just see where it goes. But publicly, we've done everything we can to provide information to people, to release information, to get all the emails out, to accelerate. We cannibalized departments. We brought people in by the dozens in order to accelerate the release of emails. We did it as fast as humanly possible, and tens of thousands of emails were processed and run through other departments, and I think we've done a hell of a good job of trying to be open and accountable.

QUESTION: On some other investigations, the House Foreign Affairs Committee today and the House Oversight Committee have called for investigations into the missing portion of the tape on the State Department's website. Do you think there should be a further investigation or that people should be held accountable for this? And do you think that as you travel around the world --

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, I'll just begin by saying whatever -- I mean, the first I ever heard of it was yesterday or the day before yesterday. It's completely inappropriate by any standards. Inappropriate. And I'm trying to find out more about exactly what happened and -- but it's completely also contrary to everything that my tenure at the department has personified. I mean, this guy stands up every day, five days a week usually or at least one of our people are there accountable to you for hours. We stay till the last question is asked.

And what's interesting about that I have learned is the entire transcript continually remained available and posted. It never was changed. The Defense -- what's it called?

MR KIRBY: Video Information website.

SECRETARY KERRY: The Defense Video Information was always available, never was changed. So whatever happened was both clumsy and stupid and inappropriate, and I'm trying to find out more details, period.

QUESTION: So can I ask you about the ministerial meeting you've had today?

SECRETARY KERRY: Yeah.

QUESTION: The final statement mentioned only the prospect of convening an international conference by the end of this year. Would the U.S. encourage this conference to happen?

SECRETARY KERRY: I have no idea yet. I mean, it talked about the prospect of it, and I think it's fair to hold open the possibilities. But right now, I think what today emphasized is we need to find some immediate kinds of steps on the ground that will make a difference. We need to work with the parties. Everybody agreed today that you can't impose a solution from outside and you need to have direct negotiations. And I will continue to encourage that. I talk to the prime minister of Israel regularly. I talked to him, I think just literally, yesterday or day before. We've talked regularly, and I will talk to him in the next few days. And I will talk to President Abbas, who I also talk to regularly, and others in the Arab community and else -- and the neighbors. And we will continue to work on this very intensely over the course of the next -- all the way to the last day that I'm in office.

QUESTION: Sir, if I can ask a follow-up on the video questions. Do you want people working for you who tamper with the historical record?

SECRETARY KERRY: Of course not. I just said it's inappropriate.

QUESTION: If you find out who requested or ordered this, would you want them to continue to work in the Public Affairs --

SECRETARY KERRY: I would like to find out exactly what happened and why. And I'm not going to make any comments about -- but I said it's a stupid and inappropriate thing to do, and I think that comment summarizes my point of view about it. And I am trying to find out the details of what this was.

QUESTION: Do you think the investigation has hit a dead end or a --

SECRETARY KERRY: I have no idea yet. I just -- as I say, I just learned about this the other day. And I've been asking a lot of questions, and we'll find out where we are.

QUESTION: Do you know that you were given the deadline by Wednesday by the chairman of House Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, to find out who is the person?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, I hope I can find out before Wednesday. (Laughter.) We'll find out -- we'll find out as soon as we can, I assure you. But I can't be more emphatic than saying a combination of stupidity and inappropriateness, and it just seems baffling to me given that records are there for everybody to peruse. I don't understand what was in somebody's mind, but until I find out, I'm not going to speculate.

QUESTION: Would there be a consequence then?

SECRETARY KERRY: I said I'm not going to speculate. I want to find out what happened.

QUESTION: What do you make of Bibi's talk about the Arab Peace Initiative, which he kind of blew off when you pushed it a few years back? The API, the Arab Peace Initiative.

SECRETARY KERRY: Look --

QUESTION: Did you see it as serious or a distraction to some of the other things going on?

SECRETARY KERRY: We -- I don't know the answer to that. We have to find out what the thoughts are about going forward, then we'll see. I don't know yet.

QUESTION: And do you have any indication yet from President Sisi what his plans are? He's been making a lot of -- he talked about --

SECRETARY KERRY: Yeah, I've talked to President Sisi very directly, and in fact, I hope to be going back to see President Sisi somewhere in the next weeks on a number of topics -- that included. But --

QUESTION: Can you explain to us some more what --

SECRETARY KERRY: No, I think it'd be inappropriate. I think that he's trying to be helpful. He wants to be helpful to the process. He's offered his ability to try to be helpful. And obviously, Egypt is an important player and has an ability to be able to make some difference on all of this.

MR KIRBY: We only have time for one more, guys. We've got to get the Secretary --

QUESTION: I have one on Syria. There have been massive bombing today on Aleppo. What could be done? Do you plan to call Foreign Minister Lavrov to ask him to use his influence on the regime?

SECRETARY KERRY: I have talked to -- I talked to Foreign Minister Lavrov today at some length, and we talked very specifically about how to deal with this problem and the cessation and move things forward. We're engaged in some very real discussions right now about how to try to move the process forward. We've had, I think, two or three conversations in the last 10 days -- something like that -- and I will talk to him very shortly again in order to continue to see where this is heading.

QUESTION: Was that on the phone or was it here?

SECRETARY KERRY: No, he was -- it was on the phone. We had a phone conversation this morning. We had a good -- about an hour's conversation about all of this. It was in-depth, and we are continuing to work on a number of ways to try to strengthen the enforcement and accountability for the cessation. And we have good ideas, but it's too early.

QUESTION: Did you talk about the air drops again?

SECRETARY KERRY: We talked about the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The preference is to get it in by ground, and we're still working on getting it in by ground.

MR KIRBY: Okay, guys, that's going to have to be it for tonight. The Secretary's got to get going, so thanks.

QUESTION: Thank you.

SECRETARY KERRY: You got what you need?

QUESTION: Yeah, it was good.

SECRETARY KERRY: Everybody okay?

QUESTION: Thank you.

SECRETARY KERRY: I mean, I think the Congress today did exactly what I said to you on the airplane. It was an opportunity to get people together. I had a particularly -- it was particularly helpful because I had a chance to meet with the Moroccan prime minister, with the Egyptian prime minister, the Norwegian prime minister, with the EU -- Federica, and with the UN Secretary General. So I had a lot of meetings during it which were all very helpful in terms of this topic, and working on the Quartet report -- the things we're doing. So it was a well -- it was a day well spent. And then I got to spend about three hours on a video conference with Washington. How's that? (Laughter.) Fun.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is John's birthday.

(Singing Happy Birthday.)

(Applause.)

SECRETARY KERRY: Good stuff, man. Growing old with grace, hey. Speech. Speech. You've got to blow it out, man.

MR KIRBY: Oh, yeah, that's right.

SECRETARY KERRY: You've got to make a wish. You've got to know your wish and then you blow it out.

MR KIRBY: Okay, I got one. (Laughter.)

SECRETARY KERRY: I want another job. That's his wish.

QUESTION: I never want to hear about that tape again.

SECRETARY KERRY: Hey, by the way, you mentioned the tape again. Let me just make one comment quickly to all of you on the record.

MR KIRBY: You guys can put this on the record.

QUESTION: On the record or off the record?

QUESTION: Off the record or on the record?

SECRETARY KERRY: No, on the record. On the record.

MR KIRBY: You can put this on the record.

SECRETARY KERRY: I want to put this on the record. I know, because I heard back home, that somebody asked a question about Jen Psaki and her role in this or possible. Jen Psaki was an absolutely superb, beyond any question, straight dealer as spokesperson. And I am convinced and satisfied that Jen Psaki didn't know anything about it, and there's no evidence whatsoever to the effect that somehow she was involved in this. And I'm absolutely -- I have total confidence in Jen Psaki and in Jen Psaki's abilities and in her ethics. So there's no question in my mind she didn't even know about this and was as surprised and taken aback as I am. And we think it is as inappropriate as I have said to you. So that I am certain of.

QUESTION: Could you say with that level of confidence -- could you say that about other officials, like Marie Harf or --

SECRETARY KERRY: I have not had a chance to -- as I said, I'm not going to go down a list. I'm not going to start playing. But I know about Jen Psaki, particularly because that would be the first person one would ask and check out and run the hoops on. But I can tell you that I have -- she was a superb spokesperson, is beyond reproach in terms of her approach to these things, her ethics. She's always been up front with people, and I have absolute confidence in Jen Psaki.

But I am trying to find out what happened here, because as I say, it's unacceptable. Not in my -- not in the Department that I run am I going to have somebody clipping -- it's just -- you'd think people learn from history, you'd think they learn from just basic common sense. It doesn't make sense particularly since it's remained posted in its full transcript and posted. So I don't know what happened, but I'm going to try and do my due diligence. Okay? Thanks all, appreciate it.

QUESTION: Thank you.

SECRETARY KERRY: Thank you all, thanks. Happy Birthday.

QUESTION: Did you see --

SECRETARY KERRY: I'll give you the low-down (inaudible).

QUESTION: -- anything about Assad's comments?

SECRETARY KERRY: I beg your pardon?

QUESTION: Assad, he pledged he would take back every inch of Syria.

SECRETARY KERRY: Yes, I know. I know. I talked to Lavrov about it. He says that the transition is still the goal and everything about Geneva is still holding, and the effort to get the ceasefire in place is what they are working on right now.

121221,1097749,MARVIN NELSON Q&A: The North Dakota Democrats' Alternative,06/25/16,3,"Q. What's your sense of how Republicans approach the problems of North Dakota?

A. I think Republicans think at the ALEC level--the American Legislative Exchange Committee. They're being told.

Think of the Stenehjem campaign; they came out and said, ""Doug Burgum is anti-coal."" Well that's because Doug Burgum, when he worked for Microsoft, actually in a few of his speeches, acknowledged there's global warming.

Oh, my God! There's global warming! That means he's anti-coal, under the Republicans' theory. Well, that would mean the president of Hess Corp. is anti-coal and anti-oil, because he admits it, too. In fact, he has a whole plan to deal with it.

Now, I think it's very anti-coal and anti-oil to not admit there's a problem, because we have to solve this. How do you put significant resources toward solving a problem that you can't even admit exists?

I think if you keep denying global warming, you're guaranteeing that in 15 years, we don't have a coal industry in North Dakota. It's going to go away. It won't even require a rule; it'll go away because nobody will buy our power. It's going to happen.

So, here's my plan. We spent $5 million on research this biennium; and in my view, if we want to keep a coal industry, we're going to have to ramp that up.

There is now an explosion in sequestration research going, so we just have to make some incremental changes. We don't have to start from scratch.

But I think that in this coming biennium, we as a state are looking at a $50 million to $100 million commitment into this research, because we're going to have to tweak whatever there is to make it work on our plants.

But to just stick our head in the sand and say global warming doesn't exist--we're wiping the coal industry out.

Of course, I know people on the left who say, ""Hydrocarbons--we've got to do without them."" But I could not as a governor of the state go down and look at Beulah and Hazen and say, ""I'm going to turn this all into a ghetto"" -- which is exactly what eliminating the industry would do. There's nothing else there that could replace the coal industry.

So, if we're going to keep that industry, we have to live in the real world, and we have to work with people to allow them to adapt to the situation.

Q. As long as we're talking about energy, I believe you introduced Bernie Sanders when he came here.

A. Yes, and of course, he says, ""No fracking."" And I'm not there, either.

The big problem we have with fracking in North Dakota is that we have an Industrial Commission that doesn't properly regulate.

And it's not really the fracking itself. After all, the fracking operation where we're at--depth-wise, and so on--is a completely different deal than it would be in thousand-foot-deep wells in Pennsylvania.

Instead, the danger comes when we're done with fracking, and we get the flowback. Then, we've got the saltwater injection wells, which have been a huge problem.

We've got the director of the state's Oil and Gas Division arguing about the definition of ""leaking"" with the Environmental Protection Agency. In North Dakota, we say we check these wells every five years whether they need to be checked or not. Ten thousand to 20,000 barrels of saltwater a day gets put into a well, and it can lose 10 percent of its pressure in 15 minutes, but we come and pressure-test it every five years--and it still meets standards.

And, of course, with the saltwater handling, we're not down in the Dakota Formation anymore. We're above the Dakota Formation. So, how shallow do you need to get before you have a ""leak""?

The thing is, you go out to western North Dakota, and there are thousands of acres of dead land. It's increasing every year. You'd think Rachel Carson came to North Dakota before she wrote her book, because you can go to beautiful North Dakota wetlands, and there are no frogs chirping, very few insects, no birds.

Literally, we have wetlands that kill ducks if the ducks land on them.

And what's so frustrating is you can go up into Canada and look at the wells there, and better than 90 percent of the damage to the land goes away. They still have an oil industry; it actually was more profitable than ours was before the Bakken hit.

And yet, it's a societal thing and a regulatory thing, because if you break it, you fix it in Canada. So, everybody talks about how great reclamation is for coal, but for some reason, we never did a similar thing for the oil industry.

Q. Why doesn't it happen now?

A. Because the Republicans won't let it happen. It's that simple. We have asked, we have pushed, we have begged. And it doesn't happen.

Q. Just to be clear, we're talking about saltwater contamination.

A. Yes. Oil is actually not as much of a problem unless it gets in the groundwater. But salt is the problem. Salt stays there; salt's a real problem. Especially because we are so very salty, compared with other parts of the country. I mean, our saltwater that comes up with the oil is not saltwater. It's liquid salt. It's literally very close to the saturation phase of sodium chloride

Q. Why aren't the Dakota Resource Council and others mapping these sites and presenting their evidence?

A. Well, they do. And that's part of the reason why the Industrial Commission doesn't want non-landowners to testify in front of the commission.

Q. It seems to fit in with the larger criticism from Democrats about whether the Industrial Commission works.

A. We'd have to say it doesn't work.

Q. What needs to change to make it more effective?

A. Basically, it's the people on there. The rules aren't necessarily that bad. But it's that they're not being enforced.

And because no one trusts the Industrial Commission to protect them, you can't get a pipeline in the ground in western North Dakota now unless you pay so much that effectively you're buying the land. They just cannot get a pipeline in the ground. This is not business-friendly.

Q. So as governor on the Industrial Commission, are you talking about changing the commission or simply enforcing the things that should be enforced?

A. Well, enforcing the things that should be enforced. But there is a structural problem here as well, because honestly, when you take the attorney general, the governor and the ag commissioner, they have too many responsibilities, too many meetings with too many staff. I mean, there really needs to be a change.

For example, we have this crime wave going on. We have gangs, we have shootings, we have burglaries, we have armed robberies; I can't even find a convenience store in a rural area that's open after 11 o'clock at night, because nobody wants to sit there and get robbed.

And the attorney general needs to be taking the lead in getting that situation changed. We gave him a bunch of personnel last session, but it's still a dangerous situation, because all those towns and all those counties out west now are doing massive cuts to their law enforcement because they don't have the money to keep funding it.

So, it's almost like the best time in history to be a criminal in western North Dakota.

And the attorney general really should be spending his time on that. But we've got him on the Land Department board. And we've got him on the Industrial Commission. And we've got him on the Bank of North Dakota board.

And honestly, I think that's a mistake. But you know, everything's going to have to be done constitutionally; changing those responsibilities is not something a governor can do.

But I think we do have a lot of structural problems as a state.

Q. Do you think North Dakotans know the environmental damage being done?

A. Absolutely not. And the legislators don't either. They all think they know, because they went on a North Dakota Petroleum Council tour. But the Petroleum Council always takes you to the newest, latest, cleanest, most wonderful places, including spill sites.

Besides, whenever they have a spill, what do they say? They say it's this many barrels. But it doesn't matter how many barrels it is; the water isn't the problem. The problem is how much salt there is in it.

But nobody evaluates the sites. For example, I have an electromagnetic induction machine, and I can walk along and tell you exactly where the salt is. As fast as you can walk or drive, it'll tell you where it's at, and it's cheap. I use it as an ag consultant for zoning fields.

The Oil and Gas Division does not use one of them. The Health Department does not use one of them.

You can buy another machine for about $20,000. You can set it up in a half-hour next to a saltwater injection well, and you can learn whether there's any contamination within the first couple of thousand feet.

The state of North Dakota has never even rented one of those. We do not want to know. We do not inspect.

Q. Are you going to try to convince the people of this before November?

A. Well that's part of my campaign. And I'll tell you one thing that I see in western North Dakota. It's kind of funny.

You get a guy who looks like a dog that's misbehaved. And he'll come up, and he's kind of looking down and kind of walking sideways, and he'll come over here, and he'll start apologizing.

He'll say, I've been a Republican my whole life, but I just can't--you know--I can't handle what's going on out here. And then he'll usually have a $20 bill folded up, and he'll slide that to you.

I thought it was really something, but it happens over and over and over again.

There is a possibility, though I don't know if when it comes ballot box time, the guys are going to be able to overcome themselves and actually not vote Republican.

Q. What has been the Democrats' problem in the past 10 or 15 years?

A. Basically, if you take our last bunch of campaigns, they were all really nice guys who ran as a really nice guy. And you know, being a really nice guy in North Dakota as a Democrat will get you 30 or 35 percent.

Q. What other big issues do you want to tackle between now and November?

A. One that really resonates is the Workforce Safety and Insurance situation. I mean, consider this story of a volunteer firefighter. He went out on a call, and he was crippled--seriously injured--in a fire. And as he has said, WSI treated him like a criminal.

On one of his trips, they depleted his bank account because they decided he didn't need the wheelchair he was using. This wasn't decided by his doctor; it was decided by WSI.

So, he has no money in his checking account. And he was sitting there in his house--plumb-full of toys, because all the people gave him toys for the kids because they felt bad and everything. But they had trouble living on the $200 a week disability payment.

You know, his wife had a crippled husband and four small children and 200 bucks a week.

So, there he sat in this house full of toys, which showed the feelings of the people in the community toward him. And he lost the house because he couldn't make the payments.

Then in the 2015 session, what the Republicans did is they took away the $200. In the House, there wasn't one Republican who voted not to do this.

They took away the $200 -- from a volunteer firefighter.

We have to have a reasonable disability benefit, probably based on the average wage across the state.

And then the other thing we need to do for them: The fire chief of New Rockford went out on a call. It was a car wreck, and he was helping the victims. He had a heart attack.

So, his insurance company says, you're on a call. You're working for the state during that time, so you're covered by them, not us. Our insurance is not paying for your ambulance--and it was an air ambulance, by the way. And it saved his life.

Meanwhile, WSI takes the position that it was due to a pre-existing condition. So they're not paying, either.

In short, this guy goes out on a call to rescue people in a car accident, and he ends up with a $35,000 bill.

Somehow this has to change. There's no way in North Dakota that any town would vote that when you have some seriously injured volunteer who's out rescuing the community, he or she shouldn't get any benefits. It literally goes back almost to the time before Workmans' Comp, when you'd get charged for half a day and sent home because you lost your arm in the meat grinder.

North Dakota is almost there. And this is just crazy.

This is something that if you explain, people automatically assume the state of North Dakota would be taking care of these people, because they can't imagine a state that wouldn't do that.

But our state is an absolute enemy of the workers and an absolute enemy of every volunteer. It's not surprising we have 17 ambulance services that are ready to fold. They subsidize the state with millions of dollars in services every year, and yet we treat them like this.

We have to change that.

There are two things we have to change: the laws, and the administration. Because as long as you put a Republican in there, we ain't changing it, because we're running it on the cheap.

The biggest thing the Republicans are most proud of is that we have the lowest WSI premiums in the nation.

Now, imagine going out to buy a pickup truck. If one dealer says he can sell you the same pickup truck for $300 less, you can believe him.

But we're doing WSI for half of what anybody else in this country is doing. Are you going to believe the car dealer if he says you can have the same pickup for half the price?",,,06/27/16 02:11 PM
121221,1097786,ND Governor's candidate Q & A,06/08/16,3,"Ahead of the June 14th primary for candidates in North Dakota, HPR asked questions of the two men running on the Republican side, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, who received the party's endorsement in March, and challenger Fargo businessman Doug Burgum as well as state legislator Marvin Nelson, who received the ND Democratic-NPL endorsement and is running unopposed. Below find their responses. Answers may have edited by length because of space constraints.

HPR: Do you think the oil boom is over in the state?
Wayne Stenehjem: No. Certainly not. In many ways, it's just beginning. Oil is commodity in high demand and our production in the Bakken region is one of key development areas in the world. Current reserve estimates point to many more decades of production coming from North Dakota. Oil prices are cyclical in nature and over the past 18 months we have been in a down cycle. Prices will come back, they always do. In fact, just in the past couple of months we are seeing an upward price trend. When prices rebound we will see a return of activity in western North Dakota. This time, however, the pace of development will be more measured and impacts will be less severe. This is due, in part, to the infrastructure that has been built over the past few years courtesy of our citizen legislators that wisely pushed funds to build roads and other facilities to address the stress points.

Doug Burgum: While the boom may have slowed for now, we need to be prepared for when drilling economics become favorable again. This pause in activity gives us an opportunity to better coordinate planning for the future. We need a comprehensive plan to host as many as 40,000 to 50,000 new wells that may be drilled in the next 20 to 30 years. The plan should include coordinated investment for public infrastructure, such as roads and water resources, and coordination between state agencies, local governments, and land and mineral owners, that will optimize the billions of dollars that will be invested in the years ahead. We can also do a better job of coordinating our efforts to protect our land and protect landowner rights. We should use the current downturn to make data-driven decisions that prepare for the new energy future ahead. My running mate, Mayor of Watford City Brent Sanford, and I support funding for infrastructure such as the Surge Bill and other one-time spending projects that went towards supporting critically-needed infrastructure and support for western communities.

Marvin Nelson: Yes, I think what we would call a boom is over for the foreseeable future. There is still business but it isn't going to be the explosive growth and people coming from all over the world to work here. The drilled but uncompleted wells act to cap the market. If China collapses economically, which is certainly possible, even probable, we could see really low oil prices.
HPR: How does the state better project its revenue so there aren't shortfalls and budget cuts are needed to be made like this last go around so we are not so dependent on the ever changing price of oil?

Stenehjem: The solution goes way beyond just addressing the revenue projection system. The long-term answer is found within an all-out effort to diversify our economy beyond energy and agriculture. Once we have developed and implemented new business sectors, we become less dependent on the cyclical pricing of oil. Incidentally, I want to point out that our legislature wisely set aside funding in anticipation of downward oil price trends. They know and understand the nature of the energy industry and responded appropriately.

Burgum: Like the companies operating in the Bakken, as a state we need to better recognize the cyclical nature of the energy industry and take the appropriate steps to manage our risk. The philosophical role of government should not change just because we find ourselves flush with tax revenue, and we should not be speculating on prices. I grew up in the grain business, and I am still involved in the family business, which has operated in North Dakota since 1906. We hedge grain daily. If we did not practice smart risk management in a volatile commodity business, we would have been out of business long ago. As a state, we need to manage our financial exposure by hedging, which would provide downside protection on our revenues and help stabilize our cash flows. This would prevent us from reaching a situation like we are in today, where unexpected revenue shortfalls force cuts to essential services such as staffing in rural nursing homes.

Nelson: One problem is the forecasting model doesn't seem to appreciate how strongly related oil is to sales and income tax collections. It's almost like they just bolted on an oil forecast onto a model for states that don't have oil. Price forecasting is never going to be great, after all its commodities.

One way to change it would be to go to a different system of how the oil tax money is divided, but it would take a lot of change. Instead of dividing up much of the tax by percentage and then the remainder goes to impacts and running the state. It would really smooth things if a certain number of dollars per barrel was taken for the impact and operations and then the remainder was divided among the various funds. That way the revenue would be much more stable, and when prices are up, more would be saved, when prices are down, less saved. This would not completely eliminate variances, but it would greatly reduce them. Along with a moderate rainy day fund, it would take some pretty unusual situations to require significant cuts during a biennium.

Another way to do it would be to take the oil part of the forecast out of the budget. We could do this by hedging our oil income for the biennium at the time of the legislative session. There would still be the effects on the other taxes, but the swings during the biennium would be greatly reduced.

HPR: Every year there seems to be fights between the Legislature and higher education leaders, what can you as Governor do to bridge that gap and make everyone work together for what's best instead of seemingly working against each other?

Stenehjem: I believe that my depth of experience both as a state legislator and as attorney general will be a great asset in linking the legislature and our higher education system. I have relationships with all the individuals involved and it's important to remember that we're all on the same team and everyone wants the same thing. We need to ensure that our higher education system is putting out a product that is responsive to the employment needs within North Dakota. I'm talking about a focus on workforce development. I think we have made significant progress in this area but there's more that can be done.

Burgum: One of the most important roles of a CEO in the business world is to clearly articulate a vision and make sure that all team members are pulling in the same direction. As governor, I'll be a leader who makes clear we as a state are much stronger when we are all working together to achieve the same goals. For higher education, that means we should be focused on producing a high-quality education at a cost-effective price for both taxpayers and students. We need to recognize that as our economy diversifies, universities, community colleges, and technical training will all play essential roles in preparing North Dakotans for the jobs oftomorrow. The legislature and higher education leaders all share the common goal of preparing North Dakota citizens to become positive contributors with good-paying jobs and providing them the best education possible. We need to focus on what unites us. We have an opportunity to differentiate our state with a world-leading education system. But to make this happen, we need to practice innovation and entrepreneurship even within higher ed. The digital economy is changing every job, every company, and every industry. We need to harness this power to take higher ed to even great levels of excellence and collaboration.

Nelson: How to change this as governor, well after getting done with the easy things, like finding a habitable planet and starting a colony there, the basic thing is people across the state need to see benefits from higher education in their communities. They need to feel a part of and a beneficiary of the system, not just a funding source. The people in higher education need to really be made to feel a welcomed valuable part of North Dakota. It really comes down to more interaction between the people in the institutions and the people across the state.

HPR: Would you support a bill which would enact discrimination protections for LGBT citizens in North Dakota and put them into law in the next Legislative session?

Stenehjem: I do support extending anti-discrimination protections for the LBGT community in housing and employment. One thing that will be necessary is to establish that discrimination in that area is a problem that needs to be addressed. No one should have to worry about finding a job or a place to live because of their sexual orientation. But these protections must also be accompanied by protections for religious freedom, especially as it relates to small business.

Burgum: As with any legislation, the specific language is very important. I believe no one should be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation and would want to work with the legislature to appropriately address this issue.

Nelson: Yes

HPR: What does ND need to do to diversify its economy beyond agriculture and oil?

Stenehjem: We need predictable regulation that allows businesses to plan with confidence. The federal administration has been challenging business with onerous regulation that impacts our primary sector business. As Attorney General, I filed more suits against the federal government than any other attorney general in the country. In fact, from January 2004 through June 2015, I filed 60 challenges. Through these actions I have scored key victories for landowners, energy producers, and the public. We also need a low tax environment for start-ups and for ongoing business. The bottom-line is creating and maintaining a business environment that invites business and industry. In this regard, our state has been doing well. According to the 2016 Kauffman Index for Growth Entrepreneurship, North Dakota was home to 245 new business startups for every 100,000 residents representing the strongest ""startup activity"" in the nation. The Kauffman Index also reported that business startups in the state grew at a rate of 86 percent last year. This rate of growth was the strongest growth among the nation's 25 smallest populated states.

Burgum: Diversifying the economy is exactly what I've spent my career doing in the private sector. We need to create a favorable tax climate for job creation -- one that will attract businesses, investor capital, and workers. Second, we need to ensure government is limited to its proper role -- nothing can squash an entrepreneurial startup's momentum like an endless stream of government red tape. We can't let that happen. Third, we need to support emerging industries, like Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), and the application of high-tech systems in healthcare, ag, oil, and our education system, by ensuring that unnecessary regulations are not limiting their potential, and also by doing our part to protect them from federal overreach. We need to foster a culture of innovation, entrepreneurship, and capital formation. We can support entrepreneurial programs across North Dakota -- which will unleash ideas and new startups. And we need to continue to work to bring value-added energy and energy dependent manufacturing opportunities to North Dakota.

Finally, we need to think long-term -- that means supporting and re-inventing our education system, from pre-school through post-grad, so that we have a well-educated workforce ready to succeed in positions and industries that don't even exist yet. That will be vital for North Dakota to succeed in the changing economy.

Nelson: There is physical infrastructure, such as natural gas to communities and reservations because industry just doesn't even consider locating where natural gas isn't available. Then we need to continue with the high speed data infrastructure.

Probably most important is the family infrastructure. People aren't going to build businesses where they don't want to live. Communities must provide a high quality of life if they are to prosper. Quality daycare must be available and affordable. Quality schools are critical. One of the biggest things is wages. If you look at history, North Dakota has throughout its history, been a low wage state, and the result was stable to shrinking populations as people moved out. Then when the oil boom hit, some of the state had high wages and it showed, we had a significant, rapid movement of people coming here. Then as the boom went away, we again are losing people. Within the state, you see the movement from low wage areas to higher wage areas. We must not continue with being a low wage state thinking somehow paying people less is going to bring prosperity and growth. We are also one of the states with the biggest gap in earnings between men and women. As long as families lose economically by being in North Dakota, they are going to go elsewhere.

HPR: What can the state do to help deal with the opioid addiction crisis?

Stenehjem: Addressing this crisis is a key priority for me. Just last month I announced a plan to address the problem. Addressing the acute shortage of licensed treatment professionals for substance abuse and mental illness is the core of the plan. A state-wide public awareness campaign is also part of my plan. We need to put a face on the heroin and opioid epidemic in North Dakota. Both school-age children and adults should be warned of the dangers of new powerful drugs invading North Dakota. These drugs are killing people and we must be communicating the hazards. The funding for this program will come from prison reform. We need to reduce corrections spending and reinvest the savings into strategies that reduce recidivism and increase public safety. When the problem of treatment availability is resolved, sentencing reform is possible which will reduce the state's current problem with skyrocketing corrections spending. We still need to lock up the bad guys but we can do a better job helping good people that suffer from addiction problems and mental health issues.

Burgum: Drug abuse is skyrocketing in North Dakota. It's an epidemic that is hurting North Dakota families, employers, and taxpayers and threatening our way of life. It's past time our attorney general begins making these issues a top priority, and as governor I look forward to working with him to address this important statewide crisis.

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Working together across the state, we need to invest more time, energy, and resources in prevention, and we need to treat addiction like the chronic disease that it is.

As Governor, I'll work with communities, employers, and health care providers to restrict the supply of drugs like meth, fentanyl, and heroin, fight the federal reimbursement incentives that are fueling the exponential rise in the abuse of highly addictive prescription drugs, reform our corrections system, and get people the help they need.

Nelson: Need to have treatment available and not just in a few population center or just through a few doctors. We need to give assurance to health providers that if they invest in treatment, we aren't going to just change our minds tomorrow. Exact solutions are going to vary by communities, but we need to look at things like tele counseling, and using our critical access hospitals to deliver necessary care.

Evaluation of people at all levels of the penal system for addiction by the state. Currently, mental health services are required by local jurisdictions, but they don't do it. The state needs to provide those services. We are in a horrible legal liability situation, just waiting for the lawsuits. Need to have things like drug courts dealing with first time offenders instead of requiring multiple convictions before being eligible for drug court. We can't afford to wait until people are sent to the state penitentiary to evaluate and deal with their addictions.

And we need education, education of the public and those addicted to deal with some of the fears and educate them in what to do and what is available. Education of professionals who haven't necessarily had a lot of education in addiction but who deal with it and its effects, professionals like pastors, doctors, and first responders. We also must educate people in addiction and drug abuse and prevent addictions.

HPR: Fargo and the western part of the state don't really understand each other as well, both appear to not care what the other is doing and the Legislators in each area battle for time and attention during each Legislative session, is there anything you can do as Governor to end that battle between urban and rural who each benefit the state in their own ways?

Stenehjem: This is a great question and I am uniquely qualified to address it since I have lived in both the east and the west. As you know, I was born in Mohall and grew up in Williston. I moved to Grand Forks for college and law school and stayed there after graduation and opened a private law firm. I was elected to the legislature representing a Grand Forks district. I understand the concerns and issues from every corner of our state. Because of this deep understanding, and because of the relationships I have built over the years with people from all over the state, I am uniquely qualified to bring clarity and understanding to the issues.

Burgum: A key differentiator of my campaign is the choice I made in choosing my running mate. I chose Brent Sanford from Watford City as lieutenant governor for many reasons, and one is that he knows and understands, firsthand, the opportunities and challenges of western North Dakota. As mayor of Watford City, Brent has been a great leader during the oil boom. He understands the tremendous opportunity that the Bakken has provided to western North Dakota, breathing new life into communities that had been on the verge of disappearing. He understands the challenges that oil development brings to these communities, but most importantly, he knows how these challenges can be addressed. Brent knows that in addition to creating great jobs, we need to build strong communities, where families can put their roots down, raise their kids, and make North Dakota their home. His mayoral experience, combined with his record creating jobs in the private sector, make him an invaluable partner in steering North Dakota into the future.

Nelson: A lot of the problem is North Dakota has never had the resources to handle the needs of its people. With the oil boom, we started to work on catching up, but we never really did. So you have the natural effects of the competition for limited state resources. It will always be easier to know your own needs and desires over the needs and desires of someone else. So there will be competition and resentment. Fargo will always be accused, fairly or not, of being a big bully, using its power to take from those weaker. Many in Fargo came there after they experienced hardships or lack of acceptance in other parts of the state, or for quality of life issues, they will always, fairly or not, think of the rest of the state in light of their personal experience. As long as the state is primarily run with the idea of reducing taxes for out of state corporation rather than providing a place where people want to live, this will not change. We must make North Dakota a place people want to live, a place where all are welcome.

53306,1097902,Interview With Emily Cheng of Bloomberg,06/23/16,3,"QUESTION: Secretary Kerry, first of all, thank you so much for doing this.

SECRETARY KERRY: Happy to be with you.

QUESTION: It's an honor to be here with you. Historically, the State Department has focused on diplomacy as a means of creating a more stable world. What's changed over the last 10 or 20 years that's made exporting entrepreneurship such a priority?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, from the day that I was nominated I have consistently said that foreign policy is economic policy, and economic policy is foreign policy. We are living -- we all know -- the word has become almost trite -- a globalized community. It's a small world. Everybody's in touch with everybody, things move so rapidly, and there's huge competition for market share and so forth. So it's a world in which you better be ahead of the game in creating jobs, creating the new technologies, and staying ahead of the curve. It's that simple. And it is vital to creating stability, making peace. If you don't have jobs for tens of millions of young people in many of these countries, we're in trouble. And it's the entrepreneurs who create the jobs.

QUESTION: Ten years ago, the President or the Secretary of State hosted a summit like this. Is entrepreneurship a vehicle for democracy?

SECRETARY KERRY: It can be, certainly. I think in terms of communication and speed, the freedom to invest, the nature of risk-taking tends to want openness. And I think it works more effectively, but it's not exclusive to that, no. There are raging capitalist enterprises going on in authoritarian governments, in countries with authoritarian governments. I mean, China is an example. It's a one-party system, it's an authoritarian government, and it is competing voraciously around the world. So -- but I think China has some challenges because of its internet policy and the nature of risk-taking there, and the nature of partnerships required in some things. I think there's a certain limitation in it in the long run.

QUESTION: Does Donald Trump threaten what President Obama has built when it comes to entrepreneurship, when it comes to innovation?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, I'm not -- look, I -- it's not my job and role to get into the middle of the election. People will make their judgments. I have said and I repeat that everywhere I go people are asking me about his statements, and they are expressing great concern. But the candidates have to fight that out.

QUESTION: Mm-hmm. One of the greatest entrepreneurs in the world, Mark Zuckerberg, was recently photographed with a shot of his laptop. You could see it in the background. He had tape over the camera and tape over the microphone. What does that say about the state of cybersecurity in this world?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, cybersecurity is a challenge. If you're not aware of what you're doing and saying and what sort of apps you have, a telephone can be a listening device as well as a communications device, and a camera. And the camera can work different ways. So people obviously need to be aware. We are working very, very hard with countries to establish the norms and have rules of the road with respect to cyber. We made progress with China to some degree. We're still working at the implementation, but it is a challenge. And we all in government are particularly sensitized and careful.

QUESTION: Former Attorney General Eric Holder recently said he now believes Edward Snowden did a public service by exposing surveillance techniques, exposing this debate. Do you agree?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, I -- I mean, I'm uncomfortable saying it's a public service because I think he exposed secrets about intelligence gathering and intelligence work that puts Americans and people in the world at risk. So you can look and say, well, I'm glad we know about these things more, but it shouldn't have happened that way. And he did it with a recklessness that has put lives at risk. And I'm not comfortable with that and never will be.

QUESTION: In the standoff that emerged between the -- in the standoff that arose between Apple and the FBI over a San Bernardino shooter's iPhone, the FBI ultimately fairly quickly when they employed the help of the private sector found a workaround to get into that phone. Do you still believe there is clear government interest in requiring companies -- in requiring backdoors on encrypted technologies by U.S. technology companies?

SECRETARY KERRY: Where there is legitimate probable cause, there is no reason that that information is more protected than other kinds of records and records that people have and keep, which is subject to lawful subpoena and lawful availability, where it meets a standard of probable cause with respect to our judicial system. And that's why we have separate branches of government, because they act independently.

But I invite people -- people need to go back 20 years and examine what kind of privacy we had 20 years ago. You could buy criminal records of people on -- publicly. You can get bank records, finance records, mortgage -- I mean, there's an incredible amount of loss of privacy that's taken place long before the internet actually came into being. People were subject to -- they just didn't know about it as much. So I think people have to be aware of the threats that we face in the world today. I think our government has been remarkably faithful to our fundamental beliefs and to our rights, and has been very careful to require standards, to require judicial review, to require different protections in order to secure people's rights and freedom. And I'm proud of that.

I mean, as I think about it, we've gone overboard in many, many different ways in order to limit the intrusiveness, but at the same time protect the American people. And I will say to you bluntly that there are any number -- in the double digits -- of plots that have been interrupted, where many lives might have been lost were it not for our ability to be able to take massively gathered -- not individual, but massively gathered and analyzed information and make sense out of it.

QUESTION: One last question.

SECRETARY KERRY: And anonymously gathered, I add.

QUESTION: Uber and Airbnb have been the breakout technology companies of this decade, but have run into a host of regulatory issues around the world. How do you balance local interests with the relentless rise of new technology?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, that's always going to happen. That's what makes it exciting. I mean, that's kind of fun in a way. Look, this has always been true. I mean, when cotton gins came along and when we first had steam engines and different things over the years, different standards began to be applied as people learned more about what the danger or threat or downside of these things are. And that's why we have rules and laws about tobacco or about lead paint or any number of things -- seatbelts in cars, Ralph Nader and the whole development of those standards. There's always going to be a tension in that. It's going to be a Ying and Yang, a pull and a tug, from interests on the ground that want the protection and from people who want the freedom to just go do what they do. And it finds its balance, I think. It finds an equilibrium. And people in the United States of America are a hell of a lot safer today than they were 25 years ago, 50 years ago, 100 years ago -- live longer as a result, less injuries in the workplace, all kinds of benefits that have come. So it works its way out in the end.

QUESTION: Secretary Kerry, thank you so much for joining us today.

SECRETARY KERRY: Thank you. Good to be with you.

QUESTION 1. What would you do as governor to address our state's epidemic of drug abuse?

When people are hopeless and can't work, they turn to drugs. Creating more opportunities for people to work is the first step to stopping the drug epidemic. I will crack down on drug dealers who come into our state and poison our people. We need to provide more treatment options for the folks suffering from addiction.

QUESTION 2. Considering that many counties in West Virginia cannot fill teaching positions with qualified teachers, what would you do to attract qualified teachers to West Virginia?

I trust our teachers; and I will get the politicians out of their way. We cannot cut our way to better schools; we need to grow the pie by creating new jobs. I want West Virginia to be an education powerhouse so we can attract the best teachers. We must pay our teachers what they're worth.

QUESTION 3. What measures would you favor that increase state revenue and/or cut specific programs to resolve the state's continuing budget shortfalls?

The lack of jobs is the cause of our budget crisis. The politicians are failing because they have no clue how to market our state or create jobs. I've created thousands of jobs in the coal business, agriculture, medicine, and tourism. More jobs will solve the financial mess created by the politicians. We should not be raising taxes on people.",,,06/28/16 03:48 PM

Transcript of Sen. Barrasso's Interview:

JONATHAN KARL: That was Donald Trump back in December, offering what would become one of his core campaign proposals, and one of several ideas that put him at odds with long-standing Republican Party policy. How does the party now square its core beliefs with Trump's campaign promises? Joining us now, the man who will be responsible for reconciling those differences, Senator John Barrasso, the chairman of the Republican Platform Committee at the convention this July. Senator Barrasso, thank you for joining us. I want to begin right with that, what we heard on the Muslim ban. This was something that Donald Trump talked about over and over again, and yet, I recall you standing there with Senator Mitch McConnell, when he called that proposal something completely and totally inconsistent with American values. Well Trump has won, where does the party now stand on that Muslim ban?

SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: You know, the platform is about the core values of our party. It's who we are. It's what we stand for. And I met with Donald Trump about it and he understands that the platform is very important to the Republican Party. It's going to be a conservative platform, it's going to be positive, optimistic, looking to the future, focused on things like jobs, the economy, and national security. And what he was focused on with that ban is national security. The platform is going to be focusing on growing the economy. We have too many Americans who are suffering, stagnant wages, this 1 to 2% economic growth that we have here cannot be the new normal for America. So the platform is going to be something that all Republicans can be proud of and national security is going to be a big part of it.

KARL: But I asked you very directly, where does the Republican Party now stand on the idea of imposing a temporary ban on Muslims coming into this country? Donald Trump won, 60% of Republican voters in exit polls agreed with him on that proposal, you called it un-American, where does it stand now?

SEN. BARRASSO: Well, the platform committee will meet in Cleveland, in July, for a full week before the convention, it's 112 members of the platform committee. And we've asked Donald Trump to allow the process to play out--he has agreed to do that. And I've asked him personally to embrace the platform, and I believe he will. National security will be a big part of it.

KARL: Okay, getting to the economy, another core issue here is the question of reforming social security and Medicare. That was a big part of the Republican platform four years ago, you have called social security and Medicare out of control entitlement programs, but look at what Donald Trump said about Republican proposals to reform social security and Medicare.

KARL: So where does the Republican Party now stand on social security and Medicare reform?

SEN. BARRASSO: We want to protect and reform social security and Medicare so it is there for future generations. There are 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 today. So we need to deal with that in a way, and the way to grow the economy is to have actually more people working. I mean that's what you do. You get more tax payers out there. More people working, more people contributing to the system, and these systems have served the American people very well over the years. People like them. They need to continue and be reformed and strengthened so they're there for future generations. And I believe that will be part of the Republican platform coming out of the convention.

KARL: Okay. I want to move, got several more of these, but we're running out of time. Immigration, of course Donald Trump also talked about deporting the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country. Where does the Republican Party stand on that issue right now?

SEN. BARRASSO: Well, I believe that immigration will be an important part of the platform. The delegates will decide at the convention exactly how to deal with this. We talk about border security and whether that's a physical wall on top of an electronic wall on top of e-verifyÂ…

KARL: I'm talking about deporting those that are here illegally.

SEN. BARRASSO: The platform committee is going to meet on talking about all of these things, and there's going to be agreements with Donald Trump, there's going to be disagreements. The platform is the core values of the Republican Party and it'll be reflected, I believe, in what we're able to craft together and yeah, we're going to have to work our way through the maze of the platform discussions. But the Democrats, they're looking at having to work their way through a mine field, which could be explosive. We are much more united as a party than the Democrats are. They're deeply divided and I believe we're going to come out of Cleveland united so we can win in November and get the country headed in the right direction. Two out of three Americans believe the country is heading in the wrong direction. It's critical that we win in November. We cannot afford as a country, another four years under Hillary Clinton like the last eight years under Barack Obama. We cannot afford a third Obama term.

KARL: All right. Well Senator Barrasso, you're going to have your hands full in Cleveland, we look forward to watching it every step of the way. Thank you for joining us and happy Memorial Day weekend.

SEN. BARRASSO: Well, thank you, too, and let us never forget those who have sacrificed their lives so we can be here today free in the United States of America. Thank you.",,,06/30/16 10:11 AM
1601,1101506,West Palm Beach's WJNO News Radio Interview with Joel Malkin- ICYMI: Rubio Discusses Blue-Green Algae Issue,06/30/16,3,"Senator Marco Rubio: ""We've been on [the algae issue] now for three years since the last time it happened. None of the answers are always satisfactory because they take time to make happen but a lot of the focus is on the water being held in Lake Okeechobee. Everybody wants the Corps of Engineers to hold water back. The problem there is the Corps of Engineers has blinders on. Their focus is to ensure that there isn't a breach, they don't want to see flooding, that's their number one concern. And so as a result, they're working through projects to replace 26 of the culverts and reinforce the aging dyke. They have 18 under contract; they have another eight that will be in contract over the next four years.

""But here's the catch, even if all of that is improved, it will make the dyke stronger, but they still intend to release as much water, especially in the rainy season because they also argue that it's bad for the ecology of Lake Okeechobee to have too much water there. So that's the problem there.

""So what is the answer? The ultimate answer here is to allow more water, instead of being discharged East and West, to be discharged into the Everglades. And that's why this year, I've been working on this for a couple of years, I finally got my colleague from Oklahoma, Jim Inhofe, to agree to the Central Everglades Planning Project.

""The purpose of that is to deliver a finalized plan, known as the Project Implementation Report that will then allow Congress to authorize a bunch of restoration projects in the central everglades, in what they call the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. So we got that passed, it's now in the bill. It obviously has to happen in the full Senate and on the floor again. We have to get all that done. We've made some progress there as a result of it.

""Again, everything moves at a glacial pace around here in this place, but at least we overcame that hurdle.""

When asked who will be able to get something done about this issue, Rubio answeredÂ…

""The Corps of Engineers is from the Army, so obviously they respond to the Commander in Chief, but from an engineering standpoint, these guys are not responsive to political pressure. Their view is, ""We're not going to let the dyke ever be compromised, and that's our number one job, to ensure there isn't a massive flood that happens if the dyke fails.' And that's what they're focused on. They get it, they see the algae bloom stuff, but that's not their mandate. It's part of the issue you have in the federal government with all the different silos.

""I know none of these answers are satisfactory. My understanding is that they may be holding back more water now, today and tomorrow. But even if they did, this will happen again until we can get more water flowing South instead of East and West. And that's why this Everglades funding is important and these projects have to move forward. You know there's an additional project that's called the Ten Mile Project that was originally a federal project, that's kind of like a retention pond, basically.

""The contractor the federal government hired screwed it up and so it can't hold as much water as it was supposed to. I took that project away from the federal government. I gave it to the state; the state is already improving it. It'll be able to hold a little bit more water and that will help a little bit. But ultimately there is only one way to keep this from happening over and over again, and that is to get more water released South. And for that to happen, we have got to get the Everglades restoration project moving. And that's why I spent two years on my colleague Jim Inhofe, a good friend from Oklahoma, who didn't want to do it, to finally agree to do it. It was a big step, now we have got to get it done. And we keep pushing to get full passage in the House and Senate because I'm pretty sure the President will sign it.""

When asked about efforts on the Nelson-Rubio Biscayne National Park bill that passed a Senate committee yesterday, Rubio respondedÂ…

""The coral reefs there and the reefs in that area are very important and we want to protect them. We also want to see more input from Fish and Wildlife in the state in that regard. They've closed off a vast area to recreational fishing, the plan they put together went too far. At a minimum there should be more input from the Fish and Wildlife because these things interact with one another.

""Senator Nelson and I got together, we work very well together, and we finally came up with this compromise that doesn't give the Florida Fish and Wildlife a veto over any sort of plan that comes out of the federal government, but it does allow them to have more formal input about what the plan looks like. We think if that works in Biscayne Bay, it will work everywhere.

""Look, I'm an avid fisherman; we're out all the time. We're in Flamingo in the Everglades, we go out to Biscayne Bay, we're down in the Keys. There is no one who wants to see this stuff protected more than I do. It would be a catastrophe for us to lose a natural beauty, particularly the oceans that surround us. But I think that can be balanced with access too, and that's what we're trying to find here -- a good balance so we don't go overboard in one direction versus the other.""",,,07/01/16 10:08 AM
1601,1101516,Miami 610 WIOD Radio Interview with Jimmy Cefalo- ICYMI: Rubio: Lynch-Clinton Meeting Raises Many Red Flags,07/01/16,3,"""Loretta Lynch is the attorney general and her Justice Department is investigating Hillary Clinton's use of her private e-mail while at the State Department,"" said Rubio. ""She now, yesterday, met with Hillary Clinton's husband, and basically he could even himself be a person of interest in all of this as the investigation is broadened beyond just the emails. It in fact includes the Clinton Foundation and links between donations to the foundation and initiatives that supported the State Department during Hillary Clinton's watch.

""And so the notion that the prosecutor, the person who runs the Justice Department, would spend 30 minutes in a private conversation with the spouse of someone her Department is investigating raises all sorts of red flags and even Democrats have admitted it,"" Rubio added. ""Obviously, they're not going to say terrible things about her, but even they've admitted that it looks bad.

""But I'll just say it's a real lack of judgement on both parts. A sitting attorney general, former U.S. President, who by the way is an attorney himself, they knew, or should have known that it looked terrible and it shouldn't have happened. I think it testifies to something broader, which is total arrogance that they can do whatever they want, that the rules don't apply to them. This has been par for the course for the Clinton's for thirty years and whether it's the email usage or Bill Clinton's time in the White House, or that meeting in the airport the other day,"" Rubio concluded.",,,07/01/16 10:13 AM

Portman, the author of the Senate-passed Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act (CARA), discussed the tragic death of Prince and his hope that we will be able ""to channel some of the grief into something constructive.""

CARA, which passed the Senate by a strong 94-1 vote, has been backed by Obama Administration experts and more than 130 national anti-drug groups. CARA will be effective in combating the drug epidemic because it helps promote education and prevention so we can stop drug abuse before it begins, promotes treatment alternatives and reverse overdoses, helps veterans, and helps women and babies, as Senator Portman wrote in the Washington Examiner in February.  

Transcript of the interview can be found below and you can watch the interview here.

Charles Payne: ""You're been a leader in the fight against opioid epidemics. You've talked about this for a long time. And of course more recently Prince's death -- the toxicology report said it was an opioid overdose and it really highlights the complexities of dealing with this, prevention and how to turn the tide. We acknowledge now in the country it is an epidemic, but what do we do about it? 

Portman: Absolutely. By the way, the tragic and untimely death of Prince I hope will now be used as a way to channel some of the grief into something constructive, which is how do we keep other people from going down this path? It is true that he died of an overdose and you know, I hope that will be a teachable moment for the country. We need to do much more on prevention and education, keeping people out of the funnel of addiction in the first place. But, Charles, we also have a lot people who are already addicted. We need to face up to this issue. Take away the stigma. Get people into treatment and get them into long-term recovery. We have legislation that passed the Senate by remarkable 94-1 vote a couple months ago. We're trying to get now the House and Senate bills together. They are two slightly different approaches. There are ways to address the issue. We have to do it. If we don't, we'll continue to see not just this tragic premature death of Prince, but unfortunately 129 people dying every day from overdoses.

Payne: Senator Portman, I can tell you just from my own personal life, I have relatives who have been addicted to drugs for 30 years or more. I know it is epidemic and I'm so happy and honored you're fighting it. 

Portman:  We'll continue to do it. Charles. 

Portman continues to put a national spotlight on CARA and this heroin epidemic. In interview after interview after interview after interview after interview after interview after interview and speech after speech after speech after speech after speech after speech after speech after speech, Portman has left no stone unturned in his efforts to raise public awareness on this issue and pass CARA, which will provide immediate assistance to the thousands of families across Ohio and America that have been devastated by the heroin epidemic.",,,07/01/16 12:25 PM

In his interviews, Portman, the author of the Senate-passed Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act (CARA), discussed his effort to make the federal government a better partner with state and local partners and his efforts to provide these groups with the funding and resources necessary to properly tackle this urgent problem. Portman also discussed the tragic death of Prince and his hope that this tragedy will result in increased awareness of the disease of addiction.

Transcript of the interviews can be found below.

Toledo, WSPD

Portman: I'm working hard to try to get this CARA legislation done, which is the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that I told you about. We got it passed out of the Senate, you know, 94-1, an incredible vote after a couple of weeks on the floor. Now we are trying to work with the House to get them to work with us on a final bill. They passed their own series of bills that are similar, but as you know this has been a passion of mine for a long time and I know you care a lot about it. You've done a great job talking about the issue of addiction on the air and raising awareness and we have to be able to get it done to help in the Toledo area and around the country.

Scott Sands: I believe yesterday you spoke on the Senate floor in reference to the death of Prince. I believe his birthday was this week and you know you hate to capitalize or seem opportunistic but obviously the name recognition that Prince has in this country and around the world is a way to highlight the opioid epidemic that our area faces right now.

Portman: Absolutely, I did talk about Prince on his birthday. You know, he was in his late fifties, he had a long career still ahead of him, he was an incredible star, and a lot of people have commented since I did that on the floor that they didn't know that he suffered from this addiction and that he overdosed, and I think a lot of folks are getting a wakeup call right now. They are thinking ""My gosh if it can happen to Prince it can happen to anybody.' Because there is a sense that, you know, it doesn't happen to those who are successful and in his case so talented and had so much fame. As you know very well it affects everybody, and whether you are homeless, or whether you are Prince, or whether you live in the inner city or suburbs or the rural areas in our state of Ohio, unfortunately, there is a high rate of addiction and we have to get past the stigma associated with it. And I hope that the tragedy of Prince's death leads to more awareness in breaking down some of that stigma so that people will talk about it more and we can get more people into treatment.

Akron, WAKR

Jason Sokol: I understand that you guys are still working on those opioid bills down in Washington.

Portman: Yeah, we got it through the Senate with a huge vote since we talked last, 94-1. I go on the floor every single week and urge the House to act. About two weeks ago, the House did act with separate legislation, about 18 different smaller bills, and now we are putting those two bills together, the comprehensive Senate approach, which is called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), which deals with prevention, education and treatment and recovery and really is the one bill that all of the groups around the country are behind and then with the smaller House bills. I think we will get something to the president's desk in a couple of weeks, and more importantly get it out to our communities to begin to turn the tide on this epidemic. Because it is an epidemic, Jason, you and I have talked about it. Sadly, in Ohio, we are one of the states that are hit the hardest. People are using prescription drugs and heroin more, there is more addiction and unfortunately more people are dying from overdoses from those addictions including from heroin that is laced with fentanyl, which is an even more dangerous synthetic form of heroin. So, it's something that we have to get on top of and begin to help save lives and get people's lives back together.

Sokol: So you think you're going to be back on Obama's desk in a couple of weeks. How far apart are you at this point?

Portman: Well, we are very close on about 80 percent of the bill. In other words, I think some of what the House did is very good and consistent with ours. There is about 20 percent that is in our bill and not in their bill and I feel really strong about that 20 percent, so that is one thing I am fighting for. Among other things, it has the education and prevention stuff in there that I think is critical. We have to take care of those people who are addicted. We probably have about 200,000 people in Ohio who are addicted to either heroin or prescription drugs, but we also have to get people from going into this funnel of addiction in the first place. That means much stronger prevention, education, so it does provide funding for, say, if the Akron schools want to do a prevention program they would be able to apply for that. It also has a national program to make people aware of that connection between prescription drugs and heroin and other opioids. Because four out of the five heroin addicts they say in Ohio are actually started on prescription drugs and a lot of them, as you know, started because they had an injury. They were prescribed narcotic pain pills, and then they end up going down this track. Most people don't know that, and I know you've talked about it on the air, and thank you for doing it, it's a great public service and you've probably saved some lives my friend. But, we have got to get that information out there more to people so they know that when the doctor says ""hey, here take these pills for your wisdom teeth extraction,' which sadly I've talked to two parents in Ohio who have lost a kid who started the addiction by getting their wisdom teeth being taken out and being prescribed narcotic pain pills by the dentist. So, we have to let people know that that is a real danger and change some of the behavior out there to avoid people getting into this really terrible grip of addiction that is so difficult to get out of. You can get out of it and there are some great stories of that and we know there is hope out there but wouldn't it be better to keep it from happening in the first place.

Sokol: How's the funding piece coming along on this? I know some folks, a lot of them on the other side of the aisle, have said that there is just not enough money attached to these bills to do everything that you want to do. Where are you on that?

Portman: I had some great news today on that front. As you know from our previous conversations, there was more money put in last year, it's money that I fought for because I thought that it was important that we sort of pre-fund CARA and that's basically what it did. It provided enough money to have CARA for this fiscal year be effective if we can get it signed into law by the president. But then for next year we just had a report today out of the Labor HHS subcommittee that they were going to have a 93 percent increase even over last year's increased funding. I wrote a letter on that, as you know, to the committee and told them that's what I thought was necessary and today I sent out a press release, basically commending the members of the appropriations committee for putting a priority on this. It means that money is going to come from other places; it means that we are prioritizing this over other things, and I think that is necessary right now because it is such an urgent issue. So, it is a $261 million effort for opioids, it is an increase of about $126 million, which is about a 93 percent increase. So, I was happy to see that today, I think that bill will pass when we get it to the floor. I'm certainly going to fight for it and so I will continue to fight for more funding but in the meantime CARA is important because that's how you spend the money and it's going forward into the future so every year you have more funding and better evidence based programs getting that funding so we can actually begin to turn the tide.

Columbus, 610 WTVN

Joel Riley: Let's focus in on what most of your conversations been in the last couple weeks. It's about opiate abuse. I've done an awful lot of reading on of late and I think I agree with you. This is a crisis that needs to be acted on now.

Portman: Yeah, look it's become an epidemic. And unfortunately, Ohio is one of the states that's been hit hardest. I was in Columbus over the weekend. We had a wonderful march to combat human trafficking. When you talked to these women that have bene trafficked, almost all of them will tell you that heroin was involved. In other words, their trafficker got them hooked on heroin and that was part of the dependence, so it's affecting a lot of different parts of our society that maybe sometimes we don't think about.

Riley: It's interesting that you got the bill through the Senate and now the House is talking about maybe trying to draft their own language.

Portman: Yeah, we got it through the Senate after about three years of work and it was a 94-1 vote. As you know, Joel, that never happens around the Senate. It was because after about two and a half weeks on the Senate floor, every single Senator had to realize this was happening in their state and we have to address it. The federal response I think ought to make the federal government a better partner with state and local and nonprofits and others who are back home doing the hard work. But there is a role for the federal government and it's to take the best practices from all around the country and then providing funding for those, on treatment, on recovery, but also on prevention and education. And that's what our bill does. It's also strongly supported by law enforcement because we help out with regard to training on narcan, this naloxone, this miracle drug that can reverse overdoses. So there's a lot of good stuff in this bill. It's very comprehensive. The House then passed a version of their own, 18 separate bills and now we're putting the two of them together, hopefully to send to the president in the next couple of weeks and we can get it out to our communities to begin to help.

Riley: That's good. That's a quick timeline. What about funding? Has there been any extra funding going the way of opioid abuse?

Portman: Well, we had good news yesterday. I've been asking for more funding in the appropriations bill that's being worked on right now for next year's funding which will start on September 30. And we got a 93 percent increase in the appropriations subcommittee yesterday which is really great. This year, the year we're in right now, we also got an increase to provide the funding for our legislation, which is called CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. So, yeah, the funding is starting to come and, again Joel, this is simply because it's affecting everybody and every zip code. I know you have followed what happened with Prince. Some people have expressed surprise that a guy with his fame and wealth and talent would end up addicted to opioids. And in case, he died of an overdose of fentanyl, which is a synthetic form of heroin. But it's everywhere. It does not discriminate. Poor, rich, famous, homeless, it's affecting every zip code in Ohio. Sometimes I think in our rural area, per capita, it's even worse than it is in our inner-cities or our suburbs. So, it's unfortunately taking more lives now in Ohio, surpassing car accidents even, than any accidental death in Ohio. So it's become everywhere and it is affecting every community.

Slavitt requesting additional information on Medicaid lead screening, and specifically, a policy established in 2012 allowing State Medicaid agencies to apply for a waiver from Medicaid's universal childhood lead screening requirement and move to a targeted, risk-based screening approach.

Pointing to a recent Reuters investigation that reviewed data in nearly a dozen states that found just 41 percent of Medicaid-enrolled one and two year olds had been universally tested as required, the two top Democrats who oversee Medicaid also asked CMS for information on the agency's efforts to ensure that Medicaid-eligible children are actually receiving regular blood lead screenings.

""Moreover, we also urge you to work broadly within the agency and with state partners to identify and support opportunities to improve lead screening adherence and lead abatement activities.""

Prior to December 2015, the FDA had a lifetime blood donor ban for all men who had sexual contact with other men, even once. Now the ban only applies to men who have had sex with other men within the last 12 months. I want to bring in Illinois Congressman Mike Quigley, he's fighting to change the FDA's blood donor policy for gay and bisexual men. Congressman, thank you for coming on the air today.""

Mike Quigley: ""Thanks Jim for having me on.""

JS: ""So I understand you and two of your colleagues have drafted a letter to the FDA Commissioner asking the ban be ended, it has 109 signatures including 4 Republicans. Sadly, that's not close to a majority. In your view is there a realistic chance that you can get this policy changed?""

MQ: ""Well we started 7 years ago and it didn't look like we had any chance at all, but even back then the FDA said that this was a suboptimal policy. It took us almost 6 years to get to the point to change what you described just now, to a one time deferral instead of a lifetime ban. I like to think that science and common sense will get us to a point where we eliminate this discriminatory policy.""

JS: ""Let me ask you this: the key issue seems to be this time period between infection and showing the antibodies for HIV which is how the blood is screened. According to the NIH, the National Institute of Health, it takes about 3 months for the bodies to produce enough antibodies--it can take 6 months for some people. So you have this period where you might be infected but you're not showing the signs that would then have that blood screened out. How do you handle that issue and that concern?""

MQ: ""I think first, you change the questionnaire to reflect that. Second, you recognize this discrimination exists because of the questionnaire. Just remember that straight men who are practicing unsafe sex with multiple partners are not denied this opportunity to give life-saving blood. While a straight [sic?] man in a 30 year monogamous relationship is denied that same right. We trust this questionnaire a great deal. So I think it makes sense to be consistent with those who participate."" 

JS: ""So you're saying that in effect, and this is factually true, we know that gay or straight men and women can be exposed to the HIV virus, so you think that both the policy and the questionnaire should reflect that?""

MQ: ""Absolutely. The science has changed and the medical communities and the blood bank communities agree this should be a risk-based decision, not one on orientation.""

JS: ""Let me ask you this, because sadly HIV has been around for a number of decades now, you've had a couple problems in terms of reporting, one is that you have this window before the antibodies show up so even if the blood is screened, presumably some HIV positive blood can get through but you also just have the fact that some people might lie on their questionnaires. Since screening has been instituted, have there been any people who have gotten infected with HIV from donated blood?""

MQ: ""None that we are aware of. We are planning to meet the administrators from HHS and the FDA to go over this analysis, help us understand the science that they're basing their decisions on. What's clear to us is, the science has improved screening dramatically, the questionnaires have improved. We have to remember this policy was put in place in the middle of the AIDS crisis and it was a lifetime ban. We have learned a lot since then; we need to know what additional research has to go into place to improve the science of screening, just to make the whole blood supply safer, putting aside the issue of gay men donating.""

JS: ""Congressman Mike Quigley, thanks very much.""

MQ: ""Thank you.""

83310,1102762,CLTV's Politics Tonight Interview- Orlando Shooting Response,06/13/16,3,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Bill Moller: Well yes, another mass shooting, this one more deadly than any before it. Oman Mateen's actions yesterday morning are being ascribed to the influence of ISIS, homophobia, mental instability, and the availability of high powered weapons. So, what can government do? Also, the impact on and reaction from American Muslims and the LGBT community. These are our three points of discussion tonight.  Congressman Mike Quigley is a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and he is Vice Chair of the Congressional LGBT Quality Caucus, and we have him on the phone. Good evening congressman.

MQ: Good evening, thanks for having me on.

Bill Moller:  Well congress is not in session right now, but in the past 40 or so hours since this horror happened what have you heard from colleagues as well as from constituents?

MQ: Mostly extraordinary sympathy and sorrow for what's taken place, and outrage for the ability of this sort of thing to happen. And, as you elude to a lot of references, the ability to acquire weapons designed for a theater of war and weapons that someone who is even on a watch list can acquire if we suspect them to be a terrorist. 

Bill Moller: Well, that is the point, they followed him for about 10 months and found out that there is no credible connection they could make to any terrorist tendencies, yet he was still able, without much effort, to acquire guns, including the AR-15 that he used. The American public we well know congressman, is on the side of more gun control.  Modest developments, not dramatically new kinds of measures, but is the time now right for some change here?

MQ: Look, I like to think I'm an optimistic person, but I suspect that the fact that nothing happened after Sandy Hook has diminished that.  We're going to keep trying, but I have to make it very plain, even if this killer weren't on a terror watch list, even if he Â… no fly list, he could still, with a background check, acquire the gun that he obtained.  And even if that rule changed, the fact is even if he was denied because of a background check, as you know he could go to a gun show in nearby Indiana, and acquire anything he wanted without a background check. So I'd like to think that at some point the madness will end.  The majority of NRA members want background checks, they don't want bad people to get guns.  It is just amazing to me the stranglehold the NRA has on our congress.

Bill Moller: You are on an Intelligence Committee, was this in any way an Intelligence failure, or the fact that you were just telling me, there have been 70 planned attacks since 9/11 but all but 10 have been thwarted. Do we need to accept that Intelligence agencies just  cannot simply stop all of them?

MQ: Well they can't stop all of them , I think the fear today is a couple things. First of all, what most Americans don't know is that we have cut back on Homeland security, particularly grants to local communities to fight this type of attack, by 50 percent in the last 5 years. Second, the terrorist are going dark. Where there is a lone wolf, inspired by ISIS, for example, who does not communicate or use his encrypted act, it is extraordinarily difficult to find and stop this person. So there are several aspects to this that are making it more difficult. 

Bill Moller: Sting operations have been successful in nabbing would be domestic terrorists, are other measures being discussed to try and get after this lone wolf you just noted?

MQ: Well this is just the need for the Intelligence community to be appropriately funded with the resources they need. As always, there is a balance between protecting the homeland and protecting civil liberties, that's something we've dealt with since the Republic was formed.  I think there is an appropriate balance that still works. We're obviously struggling with that, it is a new world. You know, I tell my constituents, this isn't our father's war.  The enemy doesn't wear a uniform, the battle is on the homeland and probably never going to end, and it's multifaceted.  We've never had a situation before where the enemy can come through a computer cable and inspire people, and horrible acts, or turn the lights off.  So we need to change our focus.  We did somewhat after 9/11, but after this attack and many others here, in Brussels and Paris, we need to change our focus here and ask ourselves continually, what really keeps Americans safe?

Bill Moller:  Something tangential to our conversation right now, you called for an end to what your determined to be an outdated and discriminatory FDA ruling that many gay men are being prevented from giving blood.  Do you think that that will now change?

MQ: Well, it is something I started in 2009.  It is a discriminatory policy that science outdates.  It is taking a very long to change.  We finally got the government to change this ban that banned gay men from giving blood for life to now, a one year deferral where we still have a ways to go.  This should be science based, and it should be risk based. I think that we are going to get there very soon, it's going to take our continued efforts, and, again, the assistance we are getting from the blood banks, American Medical Society, others who realize this policy is outdated.

Bill Moller: You think the Â… is going to be impetus in seeing that change? Are you planning to do anything specifically?

MQ: Well I was the lead author of the letter and plan to change this since 2009. So we have a renewed letter going into details, working with the HHS and others to change the policy accordingly.  I think the American public understands the inherent consistency and the tragic irony at the shooting at the pulse nightclub in which gay men were offering to donate blood and not allowed to, again not based on science.

83310,1102778,NPR Morning Edition Interview- Rep. Quigley: Orlando Tragedy Highlights Discriminatory Blood Donation Rule,06/16/16,3,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Host:Â…but not everyone who wanted to donate blood could do so. A long held ban prevents men who have had sex with other men in the last twelve months from donating blood. Illinois Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley joins us on the line now. He's with the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and he's trying to get rid of that ban. Good morning.

Mike Quigley: Good Morning, thanks for having me on.

Host: First off, this ban came about during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. Are you saying it's just a relic of that terrible time?

MQ: I think you have to remember that time in which there was literally a crisis and there was a lack of understanding, there was a lack of science and screening. Literally no one knew what the disease was at the beginning or how it was transmitted. Clearly we have a great understanding now. We have excellent testing and proof screening, and we understand what we're dealing with here. The policy remainsÂ…  

Host: And it was then the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, that instituted the ban. What response have you gotten from them in your efforts to get it changed?

MQ: Well remember this is an attempt that has taken place since 2009 when then Senator Kerry and I were writing letters to FDA and HHS to talk about this, and at that time, they called the policy suboptimal. Their response has beenÂ…they have been responsive, it has just been very very slow. Just recently within the last twelve months, they changed the policy from a lifetime ban to a twelve month deferral--which is still a defective demandÂ…denial. 

Host: Meaning that's twelve months of celibacy? Where...whereÂ…wouldn't have wanted to have been exposed to the AIDS virusÂ… 

MQ: Which is unrealistic for most people and eliminates gay and bisexual men from the donor pool.

Host: Well obviously the ban struck a particular cord in these past days since the attack that targeted a gay club. Have you heard from gay or bisexual men in Orlando?

MQ: Not from Orlando, but from generally across the country and largely from my district. I mean they recognize the cruel irony of this ban personified by this particular terrorist attack--as you say where the victims were targeted for being members of the LGBT community--and the gay men who wanted to donate blood for those in need were banned from doing so. I had heard about this when I first came to Congress in 2009, which is how we got involved. Typically with something where there was a tragedy, a national disaster, or a family issue...and gay men were told for the first time they couldn't donate. You know they met this with at first confusion, embarrassment and anger, so we began working on changing the policy. 

Host: Well just in a few secondsÂ…yes or no, do you think that policy will changeÂ…after OrlandoÂ…?

MQ: Look..it's been a slow evolution. I think at some point will when they recognize the science is there to do this and they recognize that healthy gay and bisexual men who practice safe sex continue to be banned while heterosexuals who do not practice safe sex are still allowed to donate blood.

Host: Thank you so much.

MQ: Thank you.

Host: Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley--he's Vice-Chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus.

33384,1103670,Rep. Kelly Speaks From the House of Representative Sit-In for Gun Control,06/22/16,3,"By Melissa Harris-Perry 

Even before Orlando, you gave a very impassioned speech in Chicago about gun violence. Part of what you said is ""moments of silence in Congress just aren't going to cut it any more."" Will this sit-in be part of what might finally move Congress to action?

I truly hope so. So far this year, more than 300 people have been killed by gun violence in Chicago, with nearly 1800 injured. That's just since the beginning of this year. In one city. Many other cities share a similar sorrow. We can no longer ignore the fact that America is in the grips of a gun violence epidemic. We can no longer hide behind hollow gestures like moments of silence to assuage Congress' guilt for failing to act on commonsense gun legislation to save lives. That's why I took a seat during the moment of silence for San Bernardino last year and haven't stood since. That small protest is what led to the historic sit-in you're seeing today as more Members joined me in demanding that Congress do something real about gun violence. I believe in honoring gun violence victims and their families through action. I'm sitting-in for them.

 
Earlier today, one of my students sent me a message and told me she was glued to C-Span. She said she didn't know whether she should feel proud that her lawmakers were being bold or depressed that her lawmakers were forced to take the same kinds of civil disobedience actions she and her friends feel they have to take. She asked me, ""is government completely broken?"" Do you have an answer for her?

Our government isn't broken, but it's a little bent. It doesn't always function in the best interests of the American people. But there are people in Congress who are in it for the right reasons, to represent her and her friends and all Americans who believe that their government should work for them, not against them, that it should put people above politics. Those are the people sitting-in on the House floor today. Those are the people who make me proud to be a Member of this body. And we need more like them. So I would encourage her and her friends to vote and to get their circles to vote and so on until we have more Members of purpose so we can achieve real progress for the American people.",,,07/06/16 10:06 AM
106744,1104031,"Slate: ""Some Mock and Tepid Ritual of Sanctity""",06/13/16,3,"By Ruth Graham 

Still reeling from the news from Orlando about the worst mass shooting in American history, Sunday night Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes watched a documentary about the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Himes, a Democrat, has represented a district near the school since 2009. Newtown follows parents, teachers, first responders, and others in the years following the Connecticut shooting. (The film is scheduled to go into wide release this fall.) Consumed by ""an immense feeling of frustration,"" Himes, an elder in his Presbyterian church, began tweeting a remarkable and righteous jeremiad against the ""moments of silence"" that have become Congress' standard response mass shootings

I spoke with Himes Monday morning, while he was on the train from his home in Greenwich to Washington, D.C. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Ruth Graham: Tell me where you were when you heard about the Orlando shooting and what your first reaction was.

Jim Himes: My first reaction was what my first reaction has been just about every week since Newtown, which is just horror and a sense of--it happened last week, it happened the week before, it'll happen next week until we finally do something.

Graham: The language in your tweets almost reminds me of an Old Testament prophet. Why did you use that tone?

Himes: I've spent eight years in Congress avoiding moral language. I represent a swing district. I believe profoundly in not challenging the motives of your opponents. But more and more, we're in a world where leaders have to speak up, and speak in strong moral terms.

Graham: Tell me what typically happens in the House after a mass shooting. What are these moments of silence like?

Himes: We've done a half-dozen of these already this year. As I told someone else yesterday, we should be shouting the names of the people who are killed in preventable violence, not standing there in some mock and tepid ritual of sanctity--this smug ""We care"" statement in the face of gross negligence. I'm not going to be part of it anymore.

Graham: Does everyone attend the moments of silence? Will it be noticeable that you're not there?

Himes: I sense a similar frustration in many of my colleagues. I'm on my way to Washington now, and I'm going to make an argument to my colleagues that we ought to step off the floor and read the names, that we shouldn't participate in this pathetic ritual anymore. [Connecticut Sens.] Murphy and Blumenthal called us complicit. Silence is perfectly emblematic of the gross negligence that's been shown. We shouldn't be part of it. ... I'm not going to tell others how they should best respond to a tragedy. But I'm sure as hell not going to be a part of it anymore.

Graham: There are always elected officials who tweet ""thoughts and prayers"" at times like this, and who perform these public moments of silence. Is it different in private? What are your conversations with colleagues like at times like this, off Twitter and off the floor of the House? Do real conversations ever emerge in the wake of these shootings?

Himes: No. They don't. Never. ""Thoughts and prayers"" are three words that cost you nothing. I'm sick of it. Show some courage. There's an array of pathetic arguments with the ideologues you hear, that we can't ever end gun violence. That's true. We're not going to end polio or cancer, either, but we can take some huge strides.

Part of why I chose to use the language I did last night is that for some of these folks, you need to use almost Biblical language. I've been profoundly influenced--you'll get a kick out of this, I'm a New England Democrat--but I've been profoundly influenced by Rev. Rob Schenck, the leader of a very aggressive pro-life movement. He comes out of that tradition of evangelical activism. He had an epiphany where he said there's no way on God's green earth that Jesus Christ, if we have any understanding of what he stood for, would tolerate what the Congress is complicit in. There's a wonderful movie--if you haven't seen it already you've got to see it, called The Armor of Light--and it's how I met Rob, which traced his journey to this point. He says to his white Southern evangelicals, ""This can't possibly be what Jesus wants us to do."" So I've been profoundly influenced by this guy with whom I share almost nothing politically and his moral courage. I think it's going to be strong moral language that wakes Congress from its torpor.

Graham: You told someone on Twitter yesterday that you are happy to debate the theology of your statements. Can you tell me about the theology that informs your point of view on this issue?
Advertisement

Himes: If you're a Christian you can point to just about everything Jesus Christ ever said, with respect to turning the other cheek, with respect to ""blessed are the peacemakers."" Equally importantly, if we want to examine how the faith community thinks about gun violence, pretty much every faith tradition has made powerful statements in favor of gun safety policy. This is interesting ground on which to stand, because the religious case for congressional action could not be stronger.

Graham: Can you tell me about your own faith?

Himes: I want to be a little careful. It's not my job to preach; it's my job to do what I think is right. I have pretty significant feet of clay, like everyone else, so I'm not going to wrap myself in virtue. But I'm an elder in a Presbyterian church. I've taken Scripture seriously. I really do believe, like my more religious colleagues, that religion should be a source of values. If you believe that, for God's sake, act on those values.


Graham: Does prayer still have a role to play after an event like this?

Himes: I would never denigrate prayer. It's important to people; it's important to their spirituality. It's not enough. It's not enough. Prayer did not stop Orlando. It did not stop Newtown. It did not stop Aurora. It did not stop San Bernardino. Clearly, more is called for from us",,,07/06/16 01:45 PM
106744,1104049,National Public Radio: Democratic Rep. Jim Himes Refuses To Stay Silent After Orlando Shooting,06/14/16,3,"By Kelly McEvers 


Congressman Jim Himes is done holding back. He's a Democrat from Connecticut, and after the massacre in Orlando, Himes figured that eventually there would be a moment of silence on the House floor.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JIM HIMES: Silence - that is what we offer in America that supports many of the things we could do to slow the bloodbath - silence - not me, not anymore.

MCEVERS: Himes said that yesterday. And later, House Speaker Paul Ryan stepped up to the podium.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PAUL RYAN: The chair asks that the House now observe a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the terrorist attack in Orlando.

MCEVERS: Congressman Himes got up and walked out of the chamber. A few others left, too. Speaker Ryan hit the gavel to mark the end of the silence. And then this happened.

(CROSSTALK)

MCEVERS: Democrats yelled, where's the bill - talking about a bill that would prevent suspected terrorists from buying a gun. Others yelled, no leadership.

And Congressman Jim Himes joins us now. Thanks for being on the show.

HIMES: Happy to be here.

MCEVERS: So what happened after you walked out?

HIMES: Well, I guess what's a little more interesting is what happened before. I just - that same day, I learned Sunday of the murders in Orlando. I had come across Mark Barden at a film called ""Newtown."" Mark is the father of a seven-year-old who was killed at Sandy Hook.

And so I'm out standing there with Mark. I realized that the question was there, the question that is just so infuriating, which is, you know, when are you going to do something about this? We're going to stop talking for 10 seconds, and then will go back to talking about sports and dinner and Donald Trump and what have you.

I just thought at some point, that is perfectly emblematic of Congress' complete negligence on doing a bunch of things that we should do to try to reduce the bloody mayhem that happens in this country as a result of it being awash in guns.

MCEVERS: I guess I have to ask. If you think 10 seconds of silence won't do any good, will walking out of the room do any good?

HIMES: First of all, I wasn't trying to lead a crusade here. I didn't organize an effort. And I was very careful about it because the moment of silence in that context, to me, remains more of an affront to the victims of Orlando than honoring them. But look; if it is a sign of respect and if it makes other people feel better, you know, God bless; go ahead and do it.

However, what I do think we can do is we can start talking about this, particularly as Democrats. You know, we tend to use very technocratic policy language. We've got to start talking about this differently. I mean, let's use religious terminology. You know, let's ask the question.

What - you know, which we never ask by the way, you know? If Jesus Christ appeared in front of us tomorrow and this - you know, the man who said blessed are the peacemakers, the man who said turn the other cheek - you think he'd sign on for the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun? I want to hear my evangelical friends answer that question.

MCEVERS: How do you see the influence of the NRA?

HIMES: I take a slightly different view of the NRA than most. Most people think it's very powerful because it gives a lot of money. It does give a lot of money, but I don't think that's really the key. The problem with the NRA is perfectly encapsulated by Wayne LaPierre. He puts out this fantasy that people like me - and by the way, I support Second Amendment rights - that people like me are - we have a secret agenda to take away everybody's guns. And Wayne LaPierre promotes that, and he generates fear.

And of course, as we're seeing in our politics more broadly, fear, particularly at a time of uncertainty, is a very powerful motivating factor. So for me, the NRA is not so much about the money. It's more about understanding that if you scare enough Americans, you can influence the legislature. You can make my Republican colleagues think that if they are reasonable on guns, they're going to get primaried.

MCEVERS: We should just say, Wayne LaPierre is the head of the NRA. What kind of legislation would you propose on guns?

HIMES: We don't need to do a lot of work. There was a bill that received the votes of a majority of senators. It was known as the Manchin-Toomey Bill, and it mainly featured this idea of a universal background check. You know, no matter who you are - if you're at a gun show, online, you name it. We are going to do a background check. So I would put that at the front of the list.

I would absolutely have the hard discussion about what kinds of weapons we reserve for our military and our law enforcement. A lot of these mass shootings are being committed with AR-15s, which really were designed as weapons of war. I would say let's do something that, you know, most humans recognize as smart. Let's do some research on this. We're losing tens of thousands of Americans a year. Doctors and others say we have a huge public health crisis here.

And the Congress - get this - forbids the CDC and the federal government from doing research on the gun violence epidemic. So there's a lot of easy things that if we finally got some spine around here we could turn around.

MCEVERS: Democratic Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut, thank you very much.

HIMES: Thanks, great to be here.",,,07/06/16 01:53 PM
58121,1104167,"Cook, Lovingood Applaud Lake Havasu Decision",06/17/16,3,"Rep. Paul Cook (R-Apple Valley) and San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors Vice Chair Robert A. Lovingood hailed the withdrawal of a federal proposal that would have severely curtailed boating and other recreational activities on Lake Havasu.

In May 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued new motorized boating restrictions that arbitrarily expanded a no-wake zone on Lake Havasu. The restrictions were created behind closed doors, with no notice and no opportunity for public comment. In April of this year, the USFWS announced additional draft regulations and the agency's intent to pursue even more restrictions on Lake Havasu. The controversial regulations would have prevented water-skiing, tubing, and wakeboarding within the 4,000-acre manmade Topock marsh and on an additional 520 acres of the Havasu Reservoir.

On Wednesday, the House Appropriations Committee passed an amendment to the Interior and Environment Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2017, which included language condemning the actions taken by the Service when proposing new boating restrictions for Lake Havasu.

 ""After reflecting on input we received at public meetings and the great numbers of letters and comments submitted, I have reached the conclusion that more communication is needed before any additional changes are introduced at Havasu National Wildlife Refuge,"" said Dr. Benjamin Tuggle, Southwest Regional Director, USFWS. ""I have decided to withdraw the current draft CD (compatibility determination) at this time to allow for further discussions with the community and other stakeholders.""

Rep. Cook said, ""While the recent announcement by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to withdraw the proposed recreational restrictions on Lake Havasu is promising, it doesn't mean this issue is over. We must remain vigilant and continue to ensure that federal regulators don't limit public use on our public lands.""

""The proposed federal regulations were a classic example of excessive governmental over-reach that would have ended wonderful recreational activities and closed businesses,"" Lovingood said. ""We need to bring common sense to regulatory agencies. We need to always remember government exists to serve people and that that public has a right to use its public lands -- and waterways."" 

Nearly 3 million visitors vacation at Lake Havasu each year, spending more than $200 million and supporting nearly 4,000 full-time equivalent jobs. A typical holiday weekend draws nearly 50,000 boaters to the area. Some 75 percent of tourists are interested in waterskiing, wakeboarding or boating while visiting Havasu. More than 1,000 people turned out to public hearings on the proposed federal regulations.

Motorized boating is already restricted by the USFWS on 17.5 miles of waterways in the area. The proposed new rules come on the heels of a USFWS closure last year that prohibited motorized boating within the reservoir in a half mile area that had been used by recreational enthusiasts for several decades.

A member of the House Natural Resources, Armed Services, and Foreign Affairs Committees, Cook served as an infantry officer and retired after 26 years as a Colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps. During his time in combat, he was awarded the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts.",,,07/06/16 02:37 PM

Jim Costa released the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (H.R. 4909), which included an amendment introduced by Rep. Costa.

""My amendment, which was accepted into the House-passed National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), has the potential to help regions like the San Joaquin Valley that have experienced a loss of drinking water supplies as a result of serious drought conditions,"" said Rep. Costa. ""It would require the Department of Defense to provide a report to Congress on the well-drilling capabilities of military units and the feasibility of rotating training locations to areas of the United States affected by drought conditions.  Providing relief to drought-stricken regions like the San Joaquin Valley must be done with a multi-pronged approach, and this amendment offers one way in which Congress can try to help communities that are dealing with the effects of devastating drought conditions.""

Rep. Costa continued saying, ""The defense authorization bill that Congress passed is not a perfect bill, but I supported the legislation because it ensures that the U.S. military is the strongest in the world and our communities and country remain safe. As this bill moves forward, it is my hope improvements are agreed upon before a final measure is passed into law.""

The FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) would authorize $602 billion in discretionary funds, including $543 billion for Department of Defense programs and $59 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. The legislation would raise military pay by 2.1 percent, and provide investments in capabilities for power projection, counterterrorism, deterrence, ground combat, sea power, and air superiority to help maintain the U.S. military's advantages in the twenty-first century. The legislation allows for $680 million to combat ISIL in Iraq and $250 million to train and assist vetted Syrian opposition forces, and reinforces congressional oversight over those efforts.",,,07/08/16 09:18 AM

Paul Carlisle: If I may just ask this one question, are you aware of any other states that do the equal share of funding?

Governor Christie: Oh yeah, more states do that than don't and our Supreme Court took this in a whole different direction and when they did 30 years ago, it was a radical idea back then that a court would decide. When the courts, back in the, it started really back 40 years ago in the mid-1970s when the court said that we're closing all the public schools unless the state puts an income tax into effect. That's a pretty aggressive thing for a court to do, they did that and that's what started this in motion and then the next set of decisions was about what the amount of funding should be. So part of it is political failure right, of the leaders back then they didn't make these tough decisions so the court said well if you're not going to do anything we're going to force you to do something. But now we've done all this stuff and we've seen the failure. So now we're like why do we banging our heads against the wall doing the same things we've done before? And we here all the time about people with ideas about how to lower property taxes. Well there's only two ways, right? It's either spending less or subsidizing more, it's one or the other because it's just a math equation. You know, no one's got a magic wand, right? When you sit and do your budget, you either have to get more money from someplace else or spend less. And to me, the beauty of this is we're not saying let's cut school funding. We say let's keep it exactly where it is right now, just let's distribute it differently. You know it just doesn't make sense to me to continue to ask all of you to bear 57% in your property taxes, the burden of supporting schools while these other 31 districts are at 26% or less. You know fair is fair. And so it's not only about how much the aid does but what's the aid then do.

Governor Christie:  Aiden how you doing man? You've been hanging in there during all this, is it all right? What are you doing over the summer?

Aiden Carlisle: Summer baseball and summer soccer.

Governor Christie: Great. Have fun this summer. You've earned it. You worked hard in school, earn your summer. It's good. Enjoy it.

Mayor Anesh: That's part of the deal, right?

Paul Carlisle: That's the deal. What's the deal? Tell him what the deal is.

Aiden Carlisle: School first and then sports.

Governor Christie: Excellent. Well I'll tell you, you can do it all the way through. My oldest son just graduated from college and he was baseball player in college, he played for Princeton and they just won the IVY League championship and went to the NCAA tournament. But he got his good grades and he graduated on time. So, you can play sports and do school but I had the same deal with him. School first, sports second. Grades aren't good you can say adios to the coach. And it worked. He went all the way to college, he played baseball in college and it was a great time for him and it made his college even better. He made lots of great friends and had lots of great experiences. So sports is great and if you do that while getting good grades you'll do really well. So good for you. Keep it up buddy. That's really great. Thanks for letting me come to your house.",,,07/08/16 11:36 AM
111064,1106133,Gov. Christie On TTF And Tax Cuts: We Need To Make New Jersey Competitive And Affordable,06/29/16,3,"Question: If we can shift gears for just a moment. Last night, I guess it was around 12:30 AM deal was struck on the 23 cent increase on the gas tax. My understanding is that the offset, which you have championed, is to reduce the states sales tax now by 1% but it won't kick in until 2018.

Governor Christie: No, 2017.

Question: Oh, 2017. That is going to be on your watch?

Governor Christie: Yes, sir. I will explain the whole thing to you. Okay, so let's talk Transportation Trust Fund for a second. This is what the Transportation Trust Fund is: it is a fund where all of the gas tax money that you pay in the state goes into, and we use that money to both spend and borrow against to be able to pay for the transportation projects around the state- roads, bridges, and mass transit. Over my time as governor, we have spent $1.6 billion a year of your gas tax money on improving roads, bridges, and mass transit. We usually have done these in five year plans since 1988 when Governor Kean started the Transportation Trust Fund. And this is the end of the five year plan- in two days, June 30, 2016. The last time the five year plan was renewed was when I did it in June of 2011. So we have been having a big debate. The gas tax in this state has not been increased since 1988. We are the 49th highest gas tax in America- shocking that we have a tax that low but we do. Here is the problem though, we're out of money. We're out of money. I cannot borrow any more money to try to do roads because all of the money that I collect in gas tax now, starting on July 1st is spent to pay for the debt that we've run up to pay for the roads over the last 25 years. So we needed to come up with some kind of solution. The problem is that in Trenton most of the time and especially- and I try not to make these partisan at all but I have to make this one- the Democrats usually just want to raise taxes and that's their solution to every problem. What I've said to them is ok, I'll consider an increase in the gas tax, but there has to tax fairness for people. If we're giving them a tax increase in one area because we think that area is important, having good roads, good bridges, good mass transit systems, then we need to give them a tax cut someplace else. Now there was all kinds of discussions of other tax cuts going on in the state legislature: an estate change tax change, to lower what you pay when you die; deducting charitable contributions; a retirement exclusion, for if you're getting retirement funds whether from a pension or an IRA, or a 401k; giving a higher amount of exclusions, so that if you make a certain amount of money you don't have to pay income tax at all as a retiree as a senior. All of those things were being discussed. I had being saying, like I'm just sitting back and watching what you guys do and when you get serious, come talk to me. As I told you, it's the last week so now they got serious. So yesterday they came to talk to me. What I said was, listen, the people who are paying an increased gas tax are the very same people who are paying the sales tax, except about 20-30% of the gas tax is paid by out of staters because we're such a commuter state up and down the east coast corridor about 20-30% a year of the gas tax that we collect is paid by people outside the state of New Jersey. So I said we need to have tax fairness. So I say, I've advocated let's reduce the sales tax from 7% to 6%. Everybody pays that. You buy anything in the state that's subject to the sales tax, you pay sales tax. And so the way it would work is this: January 1st 2017, the sales tax will go from 7% to 6.5%. January 1, 2018, while I'm still governor, the sales tax will go from 6.5% to 6%. So we get a 1% decrease in the sales tax what that means is it's a tax cut about $1.3 billion. And it would be the first state wide tax cut that has been given in New Jersey since Christie Whitman cut taxes in 1994. It's been 20 years since they've- 21 years since they've cut state taxes in New Jersey. That would reduce your taxes, and for the average person in New Jersey a 1% cut in the sales tax saves you about $465 a year. An increase gas tax of that amount costs you for the average driver who drives about between 11 and 12,000 miles a year which is the average in New Jersey and the average miles per gallon in New Jersey is about 24 miles per gallon, so it would cost the average driver in New Jersey about $200 a year. So I said listen, if we're going raise their taxes I want to give them a tax cut on the other side. So it's about a $200 tax increase for a $465 tax cut on the other side. You all deserve to have your expenses lowered a little bit. And here's the last piece of the gas tax, it's constitutionally dedicated to only transportation so we can't spend it on anything else. It has to be just roads. So last night the state Assembly passed that plan and also retirement exclusion. It would be phased in over the next four years but it would eventually get up to, if you make less than $100,000 a year in retirement income as a senior, whether it came from pension, IRA, 401k, and social security, a combination of all of them, you would pay no income tax. So seniors would pay no income tax, up to $100,000. Now those are to me, tax cuts that make a difference. You don't get to choose whether you pay sales tax or not. When you buy something that's taxed, you got to pay it whether you can afford to pay it or not, then your decision is, can I pay it and especially when we talk abut some of those bigger ticket items, some of us who buy a car or other things, 7% is a big number. And 1% less is 1% less on a big number is a lot money. So that's why I like the sales tax cut and I like the retirement exclusions because I want to keep seniors in New Jersey. I don't want you to have to leave because of this combination of what we're talking about in the fairness formula, on property taxes and the income tax that you have to pay on the money that you already paid tax on before you saved it. So you paid tax on all that money before you put it into your pension, your 401k, or your IRA, and then when you take it out we say, excuse me, we'd like to tax that again please. I mean wait a second, you already got a piece of this on the way in, and now I want a piece of it on the way out. I say up to $100,000, you should be able to keep it. You paid taxes on it already. So I think those are two tax cuts that make a difference and if I need to do that in order- I want to do that if they want to raise the gas tax. And the gas tax then would paid, dedicated to roads, bridges, and mass transit, and it will be paid by the people who use that system. The people who use the roads will pay for it and it will be dedicated just to that use. I've never signed a tax increase in seven years as governor, I didn't want it to be for this one but I also don't want our roads to fall apart, our bridges to fall down, or our trains not to be able to run. That doesn't make us competitive as a state and it makes your life in a state that already is the most crowded state in America, even more aggravating. I want you to be less aggravated if that's possible in New Jersey. And so now- the story's not over, because the State Senate left last night and didn't do anything. No it's not. So, they're coming back on Thursday. So between now and Thursday there's going to be a lot of conversation about this but I think it's- I've been saying all along, tax fairness, tax fairness, tax fairness. I'll consider raising the gas tax but only if we consider get tax cuts for people on the other side. It will be a significant tax cut to go down 1% in the sale tax and to have seniors get retirement income excluded so that they can afford to stay in their homes, afford to stay near their families, afford to stay in the state where they raised their family. You should be able to that, we need to make New Jersey affordable for those people on a fixed income and that's what this helps to do as well. So that's the story on the TTF. Alright.",,,07/08/16 11:52 AM
111064,1106228,We Can't Accept Anything Less Than The Best For Our Children,07/07/16,3,"Question: I've been with this school from conception, from the very very beginning when we started in Father English's school and the state came in and said ""no, you can't have it in here, you need to find a building.' They got to Mill Street and I've been with them ever since. I've watched this school birth. I've watched it produce twins, and triplets, and any other number that goes beyond that. I've watched--we've expanded. When we came to the process of getting the expansion I was like ""oh my God, yes. We can get more kids. More kids.' My daughter, my first daughter, she was the first graduating class from Paterson Charter School and I must say, she is 25 years old right now. Doing good. My second daughter graduated from here. My third daughter graduated from here, and all three of them are in college, and my fourth is going into tenth grade, and believe me, he's going to graduate from here too and he's going straight to college. Piggybacking on these parents about preparation. Preparation. I can't even talk about preparation. They go way beyond the preparation. They have Saturdays, they have call-ins, they have teachers make the time to have the kids to come in and give them the work and when the teachers give the work, hey, we see the results. Because Dr. Bertellli will tell you, the score are like whoa, they go up. They go up, so I am ecstatic. I am waiting for the approval of this venture. I'm waiting because I know the 1300 kids. Some of my kids are in there that I've taught. I'm a preschool teacher and I've been sending them from the time I knew this school even existed, so I know this school is going to excel and Mr. Reisel, you're going to have your preschool. You're going to have all the pieces that's needed and we are going to make the difference here in Paterson. It's us, but only us to make it. We're going to do it with your help.

Governor Christie: I think one of the things you said about the K-12 too, and was implied in your answer is stability. Kids are challenged everywhere, every day, by instability by things changing, and it's social, it's familial, it's on TV, it's on the internet, but we're challenged every day, and when they come to a place where there is stability and kindness and accountability, kids respond to that. They just do. We don't like it all the time, right? You know, when we were in school, right, we didn't always like it. Now I remember having my fifth grade teacher, and all throughout kindergarten and fourth grade I got all A's. I went to fifth grade and I handed in my first essay to my teacher. It came back and it was a C+, so I went to see her. I was a wise-ass back then too, so I went to see her after school and I said, ""Mrs. Banisher, this can't be right. I got a C, I've never got that.' And she said, Mr. Christie, I've heard about you. She said, you're the guy who's supposed to get all the A's. She said, well, you won't get A's in my class. You better get working. And I mean, that fifth grade year was brutal. She knew that I had more in me than I was giving and that other people were giving me a free pass, and she wasn't going to do it, and here's the definition of, or at least one definition of a great teacher. That was my fifth grade teacher. Maybe I saw her a few times between sixth grade and twelfth grade and nothing after. About three weeks after I was elected governor I get a letter at home with a Texas return address that I didn't recognize, so I opened up the letter and it was a name that I recognized. She put her name and the address and she said Dear Governor-elect Christie. You may not remember my name because I've gotten remarried, but I am Mrs. Manashin, and she said, ""And you appear to be the big-talking, dark-haired young man who I had to straighten out in the fifth grade.' And she said, I saw you on CNN last week getting elected governor, and I have to say, you turned out okay, and I mean, so think about that, right? I was in the fifth grade in 1973ish. '73, '74. I'm trying to remember. This is 2009. It's 35 years later. That woman remembered and she took the time to write me a note. Engaged, caring, right? That's the best of teachers, and Carol what you're saying I think is absolutely true. You need my help. I get it. I'm giving it and I'll continue to give it and I'll continue to speak up for this movement and for what you're doing, but you also said if it's up to only us. Well it shouldn't be up to only you but it is up to you. You already know that and you own it, right? I can tell from the way you're talking you own it, right? So the fact is that we need to stand up, we've got to stand up not for any one particular school. We got to stand up for what this school represents, which are the results, the results of your child going to college, the results of your children going to college, and the fact that whether you're a two-parent family or a one-parent family, no matter how many hours you're working and you're going to school on top of it and all the rest. Well, the school needs to recognize that, and this school does, and so they say, okay, you're not going to be home every minute of every day to be able to say, is the reading done? Where's the book report? Did you do your geometry, right? I saw Mary Pat, my wife, is now staying at home. She had worked for all these years--I'm losing that income too. That's why I'm very sensitive too because the big casualty of me running for president was she took time off from work when I was running for president and then I lost. And people think well, the thing I really lost was being president. No. She decided, you know I like not working, and two weeks after we dropped out of the race I said, so when are you going to go back to work? And she said, oh, I didn't tell you? I'm not going back. We have a thirteen and a fifteen year old and she said I think the kids really need me at home. I'm going to stay home. I'm nervous, Heather. I'm nervous because that's a lot of money she's leaving on the table but I listened to her the other day and she's trying to get the kids to do work over the summer to get ready for the fall. Our son has trouble with math. He is taking geometry in the fall. She's worried, so she went onto this website she found called the Khan Academy, right, and poor Patrick is doing geometry this summer right now. I was getting dressed for work two days ago and I heard her saying to him, Patrick, turn off the TV and get to the kitchen table. We're doing geometry. We're getting it done now so that you can go out and play later but it's got to get done now. Now, I know how hard it was for her to get him to do it when she was there. When you're not there, what are the chances of Patrick going hey, you know, I got a few free minutes here, forget SportsCenter, I'm going to get on the Khan Academy website. You know, right? But schools like this understand that challenge and the challenge to parents. Whether you're a two-parent or a one-parent family, everybody's working hard. Everybody is putting in long hours and we need the support here to back us up so that our kids can do better, and we know if we challenge them that most kids will do better, and--but they need to be challenged by us and by them, so it's not just you but it starts with you, and for us, we do this stuff together, we're going to be able to expand this school, but what's more important is what this gentleman brought up, which I think is the best point of the day, which is why, why is it that we accept any less anyplace else? We can't and we shouldn't and if we see a model that works we should do it.",,,07/08/16 01:38 PM
