The troop level adjustment he announced today, which I recommended after consulting with Gen. Nicholson, Gen. Votel and Chairman Dunford, will enhance our ability to continue progress on our two central missions in Afghanistan: strengthening Afghan forces so they can secure their nation and prevent its use as a safe haven for terrorists. In consultation with President Ghani, Chief Executive Abdullah and the Afghan government, we and our NATO partners remain determined to help the people of Afghanistan secure a more peaceful future.",,,07/07/16 03:03 PM

""I applaud the Supreme Court for seeing the Texas law for what it is -- an attempt to effectively ban abortion and undermine a woman's right to make her own health care choices. This ruling is a major win for women and families across the country, as well as the fight to expand reproductive freedom for all.

""The Texas law is quite similar to arbitrary and unnecessary rules that were imposed on Virginia women after I left office as Governor.  I'm proud that we were able to successfully fight off such ""TRAP' regulations during my time in state office. I have always believed these sort of rules are an unwarranted effort to deprive women of their constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy.""

In January 2016, Kaine signed an amicus brief in the case, urging the Supreme Court to uphold Roe v. Wade and reject Texas' effort to undermine a woman's constitutionally protected right to make her own health care choices.",,,07/07/16 03:05 PM
50772,1105396,Kaine Slams Republicans For Playing Politics With Funding To Combat Zika Virus,06/28/16,6,"U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement today after voting against a partisan Republican funding measure that would insufficiently address the spread of the Zika virus: 

""We don't have any time to waste in addressing the spread of the Zika virus, but that's exactly what Republicans in the House and Senate have chosen to do with this appropriations package. Rather than focusing on the serious threat Zika poses to families across our country by advancing the bipartisan funding compromise agreed to in the Senate last month, Republicans attached partisan policy ""riders' that would limit access to women's health care clinics -- many of which are leading the effort to stem the epidemic - as well as weaken the laws that govern clean water and the safety of pesticides for public health.

""The 3.5 million people who call Puerto Rico home are American citizens, and they deserve better,"" Kaine said. ""For years, Puerto Ricans have faced uncertainty about their jobs and livelihoods due to an unsustainable debt situation. This bill is far from perfect, but it is necessary. On Friday Puerto Rico would have faced a default on the debt, which would have pushed the island into uncharted waters and put into jeopardy the viability of essential public services like law enforcement, first responders, and health care workers. Due to the consequences of inaction, I voted in favor of this legislation. I do wish the Senate could have considered amendments to better protect the residents of Puerto Rico's interests and to give them a stronger voice in the process. This bill is the first step in a long journey toward helping Puerto Rico and I look forward to continuing to engage on this issue.""",,,07/07/16 03:12 PM
8315,1105413,"Will Republicans Push Real Solutions to End Poverty or Just the Same, Tired Block Grant Proposals and Regurgitated Talking Points?",06/06/16,6,"House Republicans are finally focusing on the nearly 47 million Americans -- including more than 16 million children -- living in poverty. Three years after the Democratic Caucus formed our poverty task force, Republicans have finally created their own.

Tomorrow, the Speaker's Office is expected to introduce its so-called poverty agenda. Will their proposal endorse proven and effective policies that build pathways into the middle class or will they leave nearly 47 million Americans with nothing more than ineffective block grant proposals and regurgitated talking points?

If House Republicans are serious about tackling poverty, will they endorse some or all of these proven strategies?

1)      Create American Jobs: Relentless Republican obstructionism in Congress has created uncertainty and instability in the economy, including the 2013 GOP government shutdown that cost our country $24 billion. Additionally, the GOP's failure to pass a budget, rebuild our roads and bridges, and invest in quality workforce training has restricted the creation of good paying jobs, especially for low-income families and communities of color. Will their poverty plan include a strategy to rein in the Tea Party extremists and restore vital investments to create good jobs for all, especially our most vulnerable?

2)      Give Americans A Raise: The data is clear. Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would give 42% of American workers a raise. Simply put, employees deserve to be rewarded for their hard work. Will the Republican Task Force endorse this common sense policy to get hardworking Americans off the treadmill of work that simply doesn't pay?

3)      Pay Women Fairly: When the average female worker is paid nearly $11,000 less per year than their male counterparts, families have less money and are more likely to live in poverty. These lost wages translate into nearly a year's worth of average mortgage payments. Will the Task Force's agenda address this imbalance that holds working women and their families back?

4)      Endorse a Bipartisan Expansion of EITC: Speaker Ryan and I have long supported an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), one of our nation's most effective anti-poverty tools. In 2014, EITC helped lift 9.4 million Americans out of poverty. Will the Speaker's Task Force endorse a bipartisan expansion of the program that would increase the credit and expand accessibility to childless workers at 21 years of age?

5)      Be Pro-Family & Pro-Worker: Too many families are trying to strike a difficult, if not impossible, balance between work and caring for children and older family members. For impoverished families, re-joining the workforce often means spending more than a third of their earnings on child care. Current programs are woefully underfunded and recent Republican budgets have slashed the already limited investments in Head Start and child care programs. Will the Task Force reverse the GOP's long-term trend of making it harder for workers with family responsibilities to work?

6)      A Place to Call Home: Homelessness and unaffordable housing continue to keep many families trapped in poverty. Sadly, this problem is getting worse. Yet time and time again, Republicans have ignored the crisis or made it worse by enacting ""rob Peter to pay Paul"" schemes that divest federal investments from our most vulnerable and needy, especially in communities of color. Will the Task Force finally provide a serious GOP response to this growing crisis instead of paying a shell game with affordable housing funding accounts?

7)      A Real Path To End Poverty: I have long called for the creation of a national strategy to address poverty with the goal of cutting it in half over the next decade. Coordinated national strategies have proven effective in the past on issues ranging from addressing HIV/AIDS, improving cybersecurity and preventing child abuse. Will Republicans make a real commitment with a serious national plan to end poverty in America?",,,07/07/16 03:14 PM

""I support the President's decision to adjust the trajectory of U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan through the end of next year and believe this informed strategy---based on the security situation, rather than an arbitrary calendar-based timeline---affirms our commitment to the people of Afghanistan and will help ensure that al-Qaeda will not reemerge, nor will ISIL be provided territory to grow, and threaten the security of the United States. I am pleased that the Afghan National Security Forces continue to lead stabilization efforts and their successes are a testament to the capability and dedication of those Americans who continue to train and advise under difficult and precarious circumstances. It is important not to forget the significant investment and sacrifice that our troops, allies and partners have made in Afghanistan and to continue our work together to combat terrorism and help bring security and stability to Afghanistan and the region.""",,,07/07/16 03:19 PM
50772,1105425,"Mosquitos, Zika and a Healthy Summer",07/07/16,6,"by Sen. Tim Kaine

As warm weather returns and the last days of school draw near, I'm sure that, like me, you're looking forward to spending a lot of time outdoors this summer. As you read troubling headlines from Latin America and other parts of the world about the Zika virus, I'm also sure you are concerned about how to keep yourself and your family safe.

Let's first understand the virus and the threat it poses to Virginia. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Zika virus spreads primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, which is one of the types of mosquito present in Virginia during the summer months. According to the CDC, Texas, Florida and Hawaii are likely to be the US states with the highest risk of experiencing local transmission of Zika virus by mosquitoes, based on prior experience with similar viruses. However, additional states are assumed to be at some risk due to the presence of Aedes mosquitoes. While, as of May 11, there have been 15 cases of Zika virus among individuals traveling abroad and returning to the Commonwealth (or among family members and close contacts of such individuals), there have been no recorded cases of someone contracting the virus from a mosquito in Virginia. Furthermore, while I'm writing this, no one has been shown to have acquired the virus from a mosquito bite anywhere within the continental United States.

Most people infected with the Zika virus display no symptoms. Among those whose infections do develop into Zika virus disease, the illness is largely mild and marked by fever, rash, joint pain and/or red eyes for two to seven days. An infection usually does not lead to hospitalization, and death from Zika is extremely rare. 

As you probably already know, though, the virus does pose significant risks to a fetus during pregnancy. The CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) have both concluded that Zika infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects.

Because of the connection between Zika and birth defects and the rare health threats the virus can pose to infected individuals, it is important for us to prevent the spread of the disease now and minimize our own risk of infection.

On Thursday, May 19, the Senate voted to approve a bipartisan $1.1 billion package to prevent transmission of the virus and treat infections. I also supported a larger $1.9 billion package that provided more resources to the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Health and Human Services to address this crisis both at home and abroad. Combined with efforts already underway by the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) and many localities, this federal effort would ensure that a robust public health initiative is in place to help control this pandemic.

With public health officials at each level of government working to combat this disease, we should consider our own role in preventing infection and stopping the potential spread of the virus. VDH recommends that Virginians follow the CDC's guidance for preventing Zika. By visiting www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention or www.ZikaVA.org, you can learn about what types of insect repellent are most effective at preventing mosquito bites and how bed nets, water treatment tabs, permethrin spray and condoms can help prevent the transmission of the disease in your home and outdoors. On www.ZikaVA.org, you can see the state Zika plan and other Virginia-specific information. 

The CDC's site contains specific guidance for pregnant women (www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy), women and couples considering pregnancy (www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/thinking-about-pregnancy) and parents (www.cdc.gov/zika/parents).

The Aedes mosquito does not fly far from where it breeds. Therefore, it is important to prevent the population of mosquitoes from growing in and around your home. Make sure to use window and door screens; regularly clean, turn over, cover or throw out any indoor and outdoor items that hold water (e.g. tires, flower vases, toys, garbage bins); and use sprays or foggers to kill mosquitoes. For more information on where to look out for mosquitoes and what products to use in controlling them around your home, you can visit www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/controlling-mosquitoes-at-home.

It's important to reiterate that there are currently no reported cases of mosquitoes transmitting the Zika virus in Virginia or anywhere else in the continental United States. While this fact offers us some reassurance, it also provides us with a clean slate and golden opportunity to prevent or lessen the severity of a large-scale outbreak in the coming months. With proactive and responsive steps from all levels of government and due care from each of us, we can take control of this public health threat and enjoy this summer to its fullest.",,,07/07/16 03:23 PM
361,1105430,"Passed in the House: Roskam Bill to Protect Taxpayer Information, Stop IRS Political Targeting",06/14/16,6,"Today, the House voted 240 to 182 to pass H.R. 5053, the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act. This legislation, authored by Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Peter Roskam (R-IL), would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from collecting the identity of people who donate to tax-exempt organizations.

As House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) said in support of the bill:

""We fought hard to push forward a ban on IRS political targeting as part of the PATH Act. And, last December, that ban was signed into law for the very first time.

""But we still have work to do to clean up the IRS and hold it more accountable to the taxpayers it serves. The Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act continues that critical effort. 

""This bill authored by Congressman Roskam would prohibit the IRS from collecting the identity of people who donate to tax-exempt organizations.

""During our Committee's IRS political targeting investigation, we learned that the IRS not only singled out certain organizations for heightened scrutiny, but in some cases it even demanded they turn over a list of all their donors.

""These invasions of privacy are completely unacceptable.

""The bill before us today takes much-needed steps to protect taxpayer identities and ease the compliance burden on tax-exempt organizations.

""Most importantly, the bill helps ensure that Americans can never again be singled out by the IRS for their political beliefs.

""I'm grateful to Mr. Roskam for his leadership on this important issue, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this legislation.""",,,07/07/16 03:25 PM

""Since the CFPB's inception, we have witnessed unnecessary, costly standards come out of a closed door agency that have the effect of law. As the Obama Administration's days come to an end, it's time to restore the decision making power to the lawmakers who are held accountable to the people who sent them to Washington.""

""The American people are tired of out-of-control, unaccountable Washington bureaucrats passing unnecessary rules, without their consent, that shackle the economy and rob them of a higher standard of living. Nowhere is this more true than at the CFPB -- where a single unelected director is granted unprecedented power to arbitrarily decide what mortgages, credit cards and back accounts Americans can have access to.

""I commend Rep. Williams for introducing the CFPB Rule Accountability Act, which applies the House-passed REINS Act to CFPB rules, ensuring that Congress has the final say on the rules proposed by this unaccountable bureaucracy.

""We are deeply heartened that the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the fundamental constitutional right of women to make their own decisions about their health, their bodies, their families, and their lives. This right, a pillar of women's equality and a key to ensuring women's health, has been well-established since 1973 when the Court held in Roe v. Wade that a woman had a constitutional right to choose whether to have a pre-viability abortion. 

""The Court correctly saw the Texas law for what it was, which was an attempt to severely restrict abortion rights and not one to protect women's health.  The Texas law required abortion providers at clinics to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital without also requiring the hospitals to grant or even consider granting such privilege, and would have required abortion clinics to comply with completely unnecessary and cost-prohibitive requirements applicable to ambulatory surgical centers.  The Court rightly held that these requirements placed such substantial obstacles to a woman's choice to have an abortion that its provisions were an ""undue burden"" on women's constitutional right to choose. 

""While today's decision was a victory for all Americans who care about the Constitution's guarantees of freedom and equality, we must remain vigilant against continuing attempts by states and anti-choice politicians to block women's access to safe and legal abortions that threaten to undermine women's health and their constitutional rights.""",,,07/07/16 04:13 PM
