108924,1105536,KSTP - Senators Urge FDA to End 'Discriminatory' Blood Donation Policy,06/21/16,8,"Almost immediately after the Orlando nightclub shooting, lines at blood banks stretched around the block. Still, one group of people could not donate, the same group of people who were targeted at Pulse nightclub: gay and bisexual men, who were banned from donating blood at all for decades and will now only be allowed to donate if they have not had sex with another man in the previous year.

""I believe we need to change that policy,"" Senator Al Franken explained Tuesday. He's part of a group of 24 senators who called the policy ""discriminatory"" in a letter sent Monday to the Food and Drug Administration.

""I'd like to see the FDA move to a policy that's based on individual risk factors rather than on inaccurate stereotypes that discriminate against an entire group of people,"" Franken said.

But that opinion is far from universal.

""I think we have rules to increase the safety of the blood supply, this is one of them,"" said Memorial Blood Centers Medical Director Dr. Jed Gorlin. He said that he's a proud advocate of the shorter deferral period but added that men who have sex with men are at an increased risk for transmitting HIV.

""My own daughter is gay and I dearly love her and I think anyone who treats her differently, shame on them, but this is a different question. This is about safety of the blood supply,"" he said. ""The FDA does not make up rules for no reason. This is an evidence based rule that increases the safety of the blood supply.""

Many blood banks have yet to implement the changes. Memorial, for instance, said they'll make the changes in January. Expect to hear more about this issue by the end of the month. The senators asked the FDA to respond to their letter by June 30.",,,07/07/16 04:20 PM
78497,1105616,"Wall Street Journal: Abbott's Strategy In Texas: 44 Lawsuits, One Opponent: Obama Administration",06/24/16,8,"By Dan Frosch and Jacob Gershman

When a deadlocked Supreme Court on Thursday blocked President  Barack Obama's plan to give millions of illegal immigrants a temporary reprieve from deportation, it marked a pivotal victory for the administration's most relentless legal adversary: the state of Texas.

The president ""is not a king who can unilaterally change and write immigration laws,"" responded Republican Texas Gov.  Greg Abbott, whose myriad lawsuits against the Obama administration, including the state's lead role in the immigration case, have been a trademark of his political career.

During Mr. Abbott's first term as governor, and while he was state attorney general before that, Texas has challenged the president's signature issues in court--tougher carbon-emission standards, health-care reform, transgender rights and others.

Texas has sued the Obama administration at least 44 times since the president took office--more than any other state over the same period. ...

Amid congressional gridlock, arguably the most consequential power struggles are no longer fights between executive and legislative branches--but legal battles between states and the federal government. ...

For Mr. Abbott, a former Texas Supreme Court justice, the effort has helped burnish his conservative credentials in a state where the Tea Party holds considerable clout. The suits, along with a recent book tour promoting his personal story, have also bolstered Mr. Abbott's role in captaining a red-state revolt against the White House. ...

Mr. Abbott was 26 when he went out for a jog one day in Houston. A towering oak tree, its trunk cracked, crashed down as he ran past, striking the recent law graduate and crushing his spine.

The freak accident left him hospitalized for months, and has since helped define Mr. Abbott's life and political ascent: from Vanderbilt University-educated lawyer to state district judge, to his appointment by George W. Bush to the Texas Supreme Court in 1995, where he served before being elected attorney general three times. ...

The lawsuits often find Texas at the helm of multistate efforts. Republican attorneys general joined forces as litigants, or by filing friend-of-the court briefs, just five times during the Clinton administration, according to a Marquette University study of partisan litigation by political scientist Paul Nolette. In the first seven years of the Obama administration, that number soared to 97.

Most of the cases filed by Mr. Abbott and his Republican successor as attorney general,  Ken Paxton, have turned on a broad theme of federalism: that the Obama administration has encroached on Texas' right to manage its own affairs. ...

In February, Texas scored another major victory when the Supreme Court blocked the administration's marquee climate policy, halting enforcement of rules limiting carbon emissions from existing power plants. ...

Thus far, Mr. Abbott has won every election he's run, including a 20-point victory in 2014 over Democratic state legislator Wendy Davis. ...

When asked about his future political plans, Mr. Abbott said he's learned to take things one political step--and lawsuit--at a time.

""You never know when a tree is going to fall on you,"" he said.",,,07/07/16 04:50 PM
27008,1105707,The Washington Post - Senate Report: Time Warner Cable is Expected to Overcharge Americans $2 Million This Year Alone,06/23/16,8,"By Brian Fung

Sick and tired of dealing with your cable company? You're not alone. Some top members of Congress are with you -- and they're calling out the industry in a blistering new report finding that tens of thousands of Americans are being overcharged for their service and may not even know it.

The report, published Thursday by Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), reflects the struggle that many consumers face when trying to talk to their TV company. It sheds light on some of the corporate incentives that drive the firms. And it finds that one provider alone, Time Warner Cable, is expected to overcharge its customers this year to the tune of $2 million. Already this year, TWC has collected nearly $640,000 in unnecessary fees.

""The company just kept the money,"" said Portman in a Senate hearing Thursday accompanying the report. ""In my view, that's a ripoff.""

The practice isn't limited to TWC. Portman and McCaskill's investigation also reveals that Charter Communications -- which now owns TWC -- earned more than $1.3 million in overcharges between January and April of this year.

The extra charges stem from mismatches in the companies' systems that bill customers for cable boxes they don't actually have in their homes. In response to the probe, the two companies have agreed to conduct regular audits to be sure their billing is accurate. TWC said Thursday it only makes mistakes on 0.07 percent of its television bill and 0.03 percent of its Internet bills. Charter said that it makes mistakes on 0.6 percent of its bills, which translates to mistaken billing concerning 63,000 cable boxes.

Even though proportionally that's low, that's still a lot of people affected by the practice, said Portman.

Industry officials said in the hearing that overbilling is comparatively rare.

""We're undercharging customers significantly more than we're overcharging them,"" said John Keib, a hearing witness who was until recently Time Warner Cable's executive vice president of residential services. ""That's noteworthy in the context of this conversation.""

Portman said he wasn't satisfied by that answer, arguing that no matter how many customers were being undercharged, that didn't help those customers who were still being overcharged.

McCaskill went further in a separate report she published Thursday, documenting the anxiety-inducing interactions between consumers and companies that have helped put the industry at the bottom of customer-satisfaction rankings. She accused the industry of playing a big game of ""hide the ball"" so that consumers cannot get the best price without jumping through hoops or having inside knowledge. She explained that she herself had been on the receiving end of a retention agent's efforts to redirect her anger when she found out she was being charged for a ""protection plan"" she never agreed to sign up for.

""There are so many things about this business model that is asking consumers to be upset,"" she said to the hearing's industry witnesses. ""Nobody knows how to get the best price from you guys. Nobody knows. There's a secret sauce somewhere [to getting what you want]. And I think it has to do with being really mad.""

Pay-TV companies point to the rising content costs they have to pay programmers in order to get the rights to air popular shows and movies as a source of the problem. These costs are growing at three times the rate of other goods and services, according to Rasesh Patel, a senior vice president at AT&T Entertainment Group. (AT&T owns DirecTV, one of the firms that the Senate investigated in its report.)

Partly as a result of the Senate probe, Charter and Time Warner Cable have agreed to grant credits to customers who have been affected by overbilling. How will that work? Well, in the case of Time Warner Cable, if you're currently being overcharged for a cable box you don't actually lease, you'll be granted a one-month credit that's worth the amount of that equipment fee, thereby offsetting the overcharge. If you're getting charged incorrectly for two boxes, you'll get two boxes' worth of credit, and so on. Customers will get an automatic credit if the company's periodic audit reveals a mistake on their bills. Charter, meanwhile, is giving its affected customers a one-year credit on their equipment fees right off the bat.

""I will never be satisfied until we have zero instances of overbilling,"" said Kathleen Mayo, Charter's executive vice president of customer operations, in her Senate testimony Thursday.

The company did not commit to Portman's request that it refund customers for the full amount they have been overcharged to date.

It's conceivable that someday, overbilling for set-top boxes may become obsolete. The industry appears to be moving toward digital apps that let you access your pay-TV channels without the need for a rented box. Still, that doesn't mean mistakes won't happen, particularly in other parts of your service. And that's how congressional reports such as these can potentially help.",,,07/08/16 08:47 AM
2109,1105729,The Hill - Senator Shares Frustrating Call With Cable Company,06/23/16,8,"By Andrew Balluck

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) on Thursday shared part of a 26-minute call with her cable company during a congressional hearing about the industry's customer service and billing practices.

McCaskill read a transcript of the call where she tried to remove a charge on her bill, highlighting the frustration customers regularly say they experience with cable and satellite providers.

The senator was charged for a ""protection plan fee.""

During the call, a customer service representative told McCaskill that the plan was for covering equipment repairs, even though the company already guaranteed to maintain their cable equipment. The rep also tried to push McCaskill onto the equipment department and warned her of a $10 ""disconnection fee"" if she sought to drop the protection plan.

""I don't think you want to lose me as a customer, do you?,"" McCaskill asked at one point, ""over $10?""

McCaskill eventually threatened to cancel her service.

""If you're going to keep charging me $10 for something I don't even want anymore, then I think it's time to switch carriers,"" she said on the call.

She was eventully transferred to another representative. That person told McCaskill that she didn't have to pay the cancellation fee.

The senator expressed her frustration with the call.

""If I hadn't threatened to quit, you wouldn't have gotten me [on the phone], and I would have been charged $10,"" she said.

McCaskill had previously posted a 15-minute snippet of the call online.

She shared the call as senators from the Homeland Security Committee panel on Investigations grilled cable and satellite representatives on their service practices at the Thursday hearing.

During the hearing McCaskill said she is a subscriber of DirectTV and hinted that the call was with a company representative.",,,07/08/16 08:56 AM
2109,1105745,"McClatchy DC - Senate Report: Yes, Cable Customer Service Really is That Bad",06/23/16,8,"By Lindsay Wise

Some of the nation's largest cable companies are overbilling customers and not refunding them for overcharges, according to a pair of reports released Thursday by the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

The first report, released jointly by Democrats and Republicans on the committee, found that Time Warner Cable and Charter cable companies have failed to provide refunds or notice to overcharged customers.

In the first four months of this year alone, Time Warner Cable overbilled customers nationwide an estimated $639,948, it said. By the end of 2016, the company is expected to overbill customers a total of $1,919,844, according to the report.

Another company, Charter, told investigators that it overbilled customers by at least $442,691 per month.

4,232customers were overcharged a total of $44,152 in Missouri by Time Warner Cable last year

A second report, released separately by the committee's Democrats, found that training documents obtained in the course of the investigation revealed that customer service agents are taught strategies to make it as hard as possible for customers to downgrade or cancel service.

And agents are compensated, in part, based on their ability to sell customers more services.

""We found that the customers who called for help on their accounts face agents whose job it is not just to solve the customer's problems, but to sell them additional services,"" said Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the top Democrat on the committee.

WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THESE COMPANIES TRAIN THEIR AGENTS TO QUESTION CUSTOMERS' DECISION TO DROP CHANNELS, AND MAKE OFFERS IN A ""TOP-DOWN' FASHION, SO THAT CUSTOMERS MUST PUSH REPEATEDLY TO GET THE BEST DEAL.Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.

If customers decide that they want to cancel service, they have to jump through even more hoops, McCaskill said.

""Although all the companies here today allow people to sign up for service or upgrade their service online, none of them provide customers an option to cancel service online without speaking with company representatives,"" the senator said. ""And if they call, they have to speak to retention agents, like the one I spoke to this week, who are trained to prevent the customers from canceling.""

The Democrats' report also slammed cable companies for charging customers fees that were not included in advertised pricing.

McCaskill said customers deserved to know why their cable companies' customer service was so bad.

""And the answer is that for too long there hasn't been any real competition,"" she said. ""In its latest competition report, the FCC estimated that about 61 percent of U.S. homes only have the choice of one cable company or the satellites if they want to watch television.""

Both reports were released in conjunction with a hearing Thursday morning on Capitol Hill, where representatives of the cable and satellite companies testified.

All the companies stressed at the hearing that they are committed to improving their services.

""We believe that investing in service and delivering a best-in-class service experience is the most important factor in driving long-term customer growth,"" testified John Keib, Time Warner's former executive vice president and chief operating officer for residential services.",,,07/08/16 09:05 AM
2109,1105766,The Washington Post - Senators Says Cable TV Users Aren't Refunded for Overcharges,06/23/16,8,"By Richard Lardner

A Senate investigation of cable TV costs released Thursday criticized two major cable companies for consistently failing to provide refunds to customers they knew had been overcharged.

The Senate Permanent Investigations subcommittee found Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications made no effort to trace set-top box equipment overcharges and to provide refunds to customers. ""Instead, their practice has been to just pocket the past overcharges,"" a report on the investigation said.

Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications recently merged.

Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, the subcommittee's chairman, called the overcharges a ""rip off"" and said thousands of Ohio cable TV customers were affected.

Kathleen Mayo, executive vice president of customer operations at Charter Communications, said a company audit determined that less than 1 percent of its customers using set-top boxes were overbilled. Mayo said the company will explain to customers that they were overcharged and give them a one-year credit.

Time Warner Cable estimates customers were overbilled $640,000 nationwide in the first four months of 2016, according to the subcommittee's report. The company overbilled consumers nationwide by about $2 million annually for the past six years, the report said.

Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the subcommittee's top Democrat, described how cable TV consumers are lured in with rock-bottom prices that are progressively increased. Byzantine customer service operations only reward consumers willing to get mad to get what they want.

""The business model that has grown up in pay TV is, figure out a way to make the entry price as low as possible, figure out how to roll people off that entry price as quickly as you can and then deal with their anger once they realize the price has gone up,"" she said. ""The angrier they get the more likely they are to get something from you.""",,,07/08/16 09:13 AM
2109,1105789,St Joseph News-Press - Senate Hearing Focuses on Pay-TV Services,06/23/16,8,"By Ken Newton

As the top Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill has access to all sorts of fact-finding resources.

But the lawmaker's concerns about the business practices of cable and satellite television companies took root when she called about her own bill.

In a Senate hearing on Thursday, at which representatives of the five largest pay-TV providers testified, McCaskill told of questioning a $10 charge for a service that had become part of the basic package. The customer service representative admitted that the charge had become unwarranted.

""I said, ""Were you going to tell me this?' And they said, ""No, you have to call in and ask,'"" the senator recalled at the hearing. ""That's exactly the kind of hide-the-ball (tactic) that infuriates people. If I hadn't called in and asked, that $10 could still be on my bill today.""

The subcommittee investigated pay-TV services and found, according to McCaskill, that consumers do not get clear information about services paid for and fail to get refunds due them after overcharges occur.

Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said Time Warner Cable overbilled up to 11,000 of his state's constituents during the first five months of this year. The overcharges totaled about $108,000.

""Not all of (the companies) bother to go back and figure out when the overcharge started, calculate how much they owe the consumer and give them a refund,"" Portman said at the hearing. ""Instead, their practice has been just to pocket past overcharges.""

Along with Time Warner Cable, corporate representatives from Charter, Comcast, DirectTV and DISH Network testified. McCaskill said the companies provide services to more than 71 million subscribers and at least half of U.S. households.

The Missourian added that a consumer survey indicated more than 20 percent of those who had interacted with pay-TV providers ""reported having a bad experience during the previous six months, the highest level of any industry.""

Tom Karinshak, Comcast senior vice president of customer service, offered a note of contrition.

""We and the industry as a whole have not always made customer service the high priority it should have been,"" he told the subcommittee. ""We regret that history and have committed to our customers that we will lead the way with initiatives to change it.""

But Kathleen Schneider, DISH senior vice president of operations, pushed back on Congress and the Federal Communications Commission for not updating the retransmission consent system to ease forced bundling of programming.

""The issues that have most consistently come up over the last several years (in customer service) involve the price of programming, and the lack of options that customers have in selecting which channels they receive,"" she said.

In a conference call to Missouri reporters after the hearing, McCaskill said she hopes to have a hearing in the fall ""to get to the bottom of how these programming costs work.""",,,07/08/16 09:22 AM

Speaking for many people who have had to deal with overcharges by cable and satellite TV providers, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, told her own story Thursday prior to questioning pay-TV industry leaders.

The hearing included a representative of Charter Communications, which provides service in Warrensburg.

The ranking Democrat on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, McCaskill described her conversation with a cable representative about a $7.99 overcharge on the bill.

McCaskill read from a transcript of conversations that resulted with two pay-TV representatives when she questioned her bill.

""I knew to keep bugging them and threatening to leave,"" she said. ""Eventually, I got a good result.""

THE CONVERSATION

Excerpts from the roughly 15-minute conversations with two pay-TV people include

McCaskill: ""I would like to have you remove.  There's a fee on here, I don't know how it got on, for a protection plan. I don't recall buying that or being asked about it, and I would like to have it removed.""

First person: ""You'd like to know what it's for?""

McCaskill: ""No, I'd like to take it off.""

First person: The plan protects against equipment problems.

McCaskill: ""Let's just say if it's your equipment and something goes wrong with it, don't you have to fix it anyway if I'm going to be able to get the service I'm paying for?""

First person: She attempts to connect McCaskill to the equipment department.

McCaskill: ""Wait, wait, wait. I don't want to do that, because if you do that I'll have to tell the story all over again. I just want to find out about why I cannot get you to take off the $7.99 protection plan.""

First person: ""I'm not saying I'm not able to take it off."" She said the plan has benefits.

McCaskill: ""Frankly, I think it's kind of a rip-off because you own all the equipment.  If you couldn't fix the equipment, then I couldn't get the service.""

First person: ""If I actually had the protection plan taken off, there would be a $10 disconnection fee.""

McCaskill: ""It would be a $10 disconnection fee for me to quit paying the $7.99 every month?

First person: ""That's correct."" 

McCaskill: ""What am I paying for? For you just to quit charging me for this service?  Maybe it's time for me to switch carriers""

First person: ""Once it's taken off, there's going to be a $10 charge.""

McCaskill: ""And you have no choice in that?  You're telling me that's required?""

First person: ""That's correct."" 

McCaskill: ""I don't really think you want to lose me as a customer, do you, over $10?""

First person: ""We really do value your business, but it's just the policy here, so once I take it off, there will be the $10 charge."" 

The first person switched McCaskill to a senior agent in West Virginia.

McCaskill: ""I don't know why you guys make us repeat everything.  If the equipment belongs to you if it doesn't work, I think you have an obligation to make it work. Or I can't see TV and then I don't have to pay for it.

Senior agent: ""I guess the rationale on that, Claire, is the account, the equipment is under your care.

McCaskill: ""Yeah.""

Senior agent: ""And we're not the only companies in the TV industry (that) charge for service calls. I mean that's""

McCaskill: ""I don't know what I'm paying for with the advanced receiver service. I don't know what the hell that is. But it's on my bill every month.""

Senior agent: ""That's either HD or DVR.""

McCaskill: "" Many companies don't even charge for HD anymore. So you guys changed, you had HD and then you didn't have HD, and then you've got this which sounds like something that nobody really knows what it is.  It seems to me $7.99 a month is probably a profit center for you guys and I'd like to have it off my bill.""

Senior agent: ""Fair enough.""

McCaskill: ""And the other thing I'd like to know is, the person I talked to before you said in order to get it off my bill, I had to pay $10.""

Senior agent: ""If you've had it for less than a year then this is true.""

McCaskill: ""OK. And I have no choice on that. So, when I bought it, I was told if you cancel it in less than a year then you have to pay $10?""

Senior agent: ""That's normal protocol."" 

McCaskill: OK, and when did I begin the $7.99 a month?

Senior agent: ""I'm checking that now. So you've had it over a year, that $10 wouldn't really apply to you Claire, it's a moot point.""

McCaskill: ""Really, and that's so interesting.""

Senior agent: ""Did we tell you you would be charged?""

McCaskill: ""Absolutely, and the woman said she had to charge me. So if I hadn't threatened to quit, you wouldn't have ever gotten me, and I would have been charged the $10.""

Senior agent: ""You wouldn't have been charged the $10 because the system would have known that it was on there for over a year. You wouldn't have been charged in any way."" 

McCaskill: ""That she was just wrong.""

Senior agent: ""That she didn't take the extra step to pull up the specific like I did a moment ago.""

McCaskill:  ""Do you think that was because she was trying to get me to hold onto the $7.99 fee and threatening me with the $10 because then maybe I wouldn't cancel the $7.99?""

Senior agent: ""No.""

McCaskill: ""Oh, come on. You're killing me. You're just killing me.""

Senior agent:  ""It's not really that insidious.  Now if it's something like trying to sell like a questionable bill of goods just for padding? No certainly not. I mean some TV companies out there charge $99 for the service calls and $47 to have their protection plans. So we've got a pretty good value of ours in the grand scheme of things. Whether you agree with it or not is totally up to you, we respect that.""

McCaskill: ""Well, the good news is you're going to take the  $7.99 off and since I threatened to quit I got you and I found that it wasn't going to cost me 10 bucks. So thank you and if you'd remove that from my bill I'd really appreciate it.""

Senior agent:  ""OK, I'm going to put 10 extra dollars of Well $10 of credit off the next 12 cycles for you just for calling in today. No strings.""

McCaskill: ""Thank you.""

SENATE TESTIMONY

Charter Communication's executive vice president of customer operations, Kathleen Mayo, joined others who testified during the hearing. She said Charter has made substantial progress toward improving customer service.

""Our representatives engage in conversations with our customers to understand their unique needs in order to properly assist them. We do not follow canned scripts,"" Mayo said.

Charter has acted to simplify billing by eliminating some fees and improving service, she said.

""As a result of these steps and the $7 billion we've invested in our network, customer service calls have declined 25 percent since 2013,"" Mayo said, and there are no early termination fees to prevent customers from leaving. ""Our customer satisfaction has improved by 12 percent.""

Charter continues to work to prevent accidental overcharges, she said.

The billing accuracy rate of 99.4 percent is high, but the company continues to push to improve, Mayo said.

""No accuracy rate short of 100 percent is acceptable,"" she testified. ""As a result, we are reconciling every single account every single day to assure our billing's accurate.""

FOLLOW UP

After the hearing, McCaskill said consumers may not get clear information about promotional rates, what is on bills and over-charges that are never refunded.

""In Missouri alone last year, more than half a million dollars was pocketed by the cable companies in overcharges without them making an effort to refund that money to customers,"" she said.

""I'm pretty confident that most Missourians can save money on their cable and satellite TV bills if they'll take a few minutes to look at the report,"" McCaskill said.

Another hearing will follow, she said.

""The next step is an investigation into the programming costs,"" McCaskill said. ""I have talked to a lot of constituents who complain about how many channels they have to pay for that they don't watch, so I want to get to the bottom of how the programming costs work.""

McCaskill said some parts of the state have more provider choices than five years ago, but there is a gap of oversight.

""There is a heavy lobbying presence of pay-TV. I have felt the pressure coming at me many different ways,"" she said, ""to not do this investigation and not do this hearing, and not to really issue a report that has as much detail in it as our report has. But  I get a lot of complaints from my constituents about this. I think I have a duty to do oversight when people bring problems to my attention.""

Whether legislation will follow the hearing is unclear, but just asking questions can prompt change, McCaskill said.

27016,1105846,GAO to Prove Financially Struggling Central States Pension Fund,07/05/16,8,"By Clarissa Hawes
The Government Accountability Office said it would investigate investment decisions made by Central States Pension Fund trustees.
 
""We accepted the request, but the work has not started yet, so we have no details on exactly what we will cover or any time frames,"" Chuck Young, a GAO spokesman, told Trucks.com on Friday.
 
In May, the Treasury Department rejected a proposal by the Central States Pension Fund to slash the benefits of more than 270,000 Teamsters union retirees, including truck drivers and dockworkers, by as much as 70 percent. Trustees said the cuts were necessary because the fund was expected to run out of money in about 10 years.
 
The fund listed $16.8 billion in assets and $35 billion in retiree obligations as of year-end.
 
Fifty-one Democrats, including 41 House members and 10 senators, sent letters to the GAO on June 20 calling for an investigation into alleged ""mishandling"" of the fund.
 
""It's astonishing to now read about how Wall Street firms hired by Central States invested retirees' pension funds in Iraqi banks in 2008 right in the middle of a full-scale war in Iraq,"" said Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio.  ""Or how they invested in unstable Russian banks when the economy there is in shambles, or how they sunk $1.4 billion into risky Single-A-rated mortgage-backed bonds in the middle of the housing meltdown.""
 
Central States was not available for comment about the GAO decision on Friday
 
Kaptur and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced companion bills in June 2015 that called for the repeal of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which allows pension funds to slash retirees' pensions if they are in danger of failing. The legislation was designed to relieve the burden of insolvent pension funds on the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.
 
The law was part of the Omnibus Spending Bill of 2014. However, lawmakers weren't allowed to vote on the merits of the particular bill, and many didn't have a chance to read the bill because it was attached to other legislation as a so-called self-executing amendment.
 
The GAO is also investigating the Department of Labor's oversight of the Central States pension fund after a request by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).
 
""Concerns over the solvency of these plans are heightened due to large fiscal deficits currently facing the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's multiemployer guarantee program,"" Grassley said. ""As a result, should Central States, or another large plan become insolvent, PBGC would likely not have enough funds to make full guarantee payments to beneficiaries who would see much of their retirement savings wiped out.""
 
The pension fund has operated under a consent decree granted by the Labor Department in the mid- 1980s after an investigation into the fund found ""gross mismanagement and self-dealing by fund managers,"" Grassley said.
 
Grassley is calling for the review because there hasn't been one since 1985. Because the fund has been facing solvency issues since the early 2000s, Grassley said he wants to learn if the Labor Department took appropriate actions when it became aware of the fund's dire financial situation.
 
Other questions Grassley wants the GAO to answer include whether Central States investments are consistent with comparable pension plans that have remained solvent, such as the Western Conference of Teamster Pension Plan.
 
The pension fund said in a statement in May that filing a plan that would slash retirees' benefits was ""gut wrenching,"" but that it was disappointed with Treasury's decision, ""as we believe the rescue plan provided the only realistic solution to avoiding insolvency.""
 
Central States said the only way the fund won't run out of money is either through government funding, either directly to its pension fund or through the PBGC. The fund is urging pension participants to ""call their congressional representatives to demand legislative action that protects their pension benefits.""
 
""In the coming months, we will do everything in our power to support a legislative solution that protects the pension benefits of the more than 400,000 Central States participants and beneficiaries, who should not have to bear the emotional trauma of waiting until the fund is at the doorstep of insolvency before Congress acts,"" Central States said.",,,07/08/16 09:43 AM
27016,1105857,"Development is a Major Step in Ending Veteran Homelessness in Toledo, Ohio",07/01/16,8,"By Donna Kimura
Commons at Garden Lake has taken veterans off the streets and given them a stable home.
 
A permanent supportive housing development, the new community combines 75 affordable housing units with critical on-site services in Toledo, Ohio. It's a central piece in the effort to end veteran homelessness in the city.
 
Built exclusively for homeless and disabled veterans, many of the residents have come from the streets and shelters. Sixteen of the units serve chronically homeless individuals. Commons at Garden Lake follows the Housing First model, which prioritizes providing permanent housing to people experiencing homelessness. The housing then serves as a foundation to receive services and improve their lives.
 
""There's an incredible number of heroes living in the building, but there was also an incredible number of heroes that helped us get this building done,"" says Michelle Norris, executive vice president of external affairs and strategic initiatives at National Church Residences, the nonprofit developer.
 
U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur was a major driver in the project. She heard about National Church Residences' veterans project in Columbus, Ohio, and asked how a similar development could be built in her district in Toledo and then helped convene the key parties, including city, housing, and veteran organizations.
 
""From the beginning, there was a sense that we were all in this together,"" Norris says.
 
Completed in 2015, Commons at Garden Lake is the first community in Ohio to use project-based VASH (Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing) vouchers, which combine rental assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development with case management and clinical services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
 
Thirty-five units have project-based VASH vouchers, and the other units have project-based vouchers from the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority.
 
The average age of residents at Commons at Garden Lake is 56. At many of National Church Residences' supportive housing developments, the average age is hitting 50 or older, which means there is an ever growing need to address many long-term chronic conditions of the residents.
 
Recognizing that many residents will likely have medical needs, National Church Residences has now added access to primary care on site in addition to the case management services that have historically been provided. It has partnered with the VA to provide offices for various services at the new building, which recently received the LEED for Homes GOLD status. The development is also a short walk from a new $48 million Veterans Affairs Toledo Community-Based Outpatient Clinic which allows additional access to medical services beyond primary care.

27016,1105864,Congress Jumps on Bandwagon to Reduce Biologic Drug Exclusivity Term,06/30/16,8,"By Kevin E. Noonan
Ever since the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) was passed along with the rest of the healthcare law commonly called ""Obamacare"" in 2010, the Obama Administration has included in every budget a proposal to reduce the exclusivity term for biologic drugs from 12 years to 7 years (see ""President's Latest Budget Proposal Seeks Decrease of Data Exclusivity Period and Elimination of Pay-for-Delay Agreements"").  Last Thursday, Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL 9th) introduced a bill (H.R. 5573, the ""Price Relief, Innovation, and Competition for Essential Drugs Act""; the ""PRICED Act"") to do just that, joined by Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-MD 7th), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT 3rd), Lloyd Doggett (D-TX 35th), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH 9th), Jim McDermott (D-WA-7th), and Peter Welch (D-VT); Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and John McCain (R-AZ) are co-sponsors of an identical companion bill in the Senate (S. 3094).  Their motivation is simple:  the Government Accounting Office released a report last October finding that the Federal government had spent more than $4.4 billion on newly approved biologic drugs through its Medicare Part B program in 2013.  The text of the bill reads in its entirety as follows:
 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to shorten the exclusivity period for brand name biological products from 12 to 7 years.
 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 
This Act may be cited as the ""Price Relief, Innovation, and Competition for Essential Drugs Act"" or the ""PRICED Act"".
 
SEC. 2. EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD FOR BRAND NAME BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS.
 
(a) In General.--Section 351(k)(7)(A) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)(7)(A)) is amended by striking ""12 years"" and inserting ""7 years"".
 
(b) Conforming Changes.--Paragraphs (2)(A) and (3)(A) of section 351(m) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(m)) is amended by striking ""12 years"" each place it appears and inserting ""7 years"".
 
(c) Applicability.--This Act and the amendments made by this Act apply only with respect to a biological product for which the reference product (as such term is used in section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262)) is licensed under subsection (a) of such section on or after the date of enactment of this Act.
 
Subpart (c) is important, of course, to forestall claims that enactment of the bill would constitute a taking requiring recompense, which of course could wipe out (at least in the short term) any savings the government might garner by imposing this change.
 
The bill was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce in the House and Sen. Brown's companion bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
 
Despite the logic of the members' motivations, it is curious that the issue has arisen now (or perhaps lobbyist for the biosimilar industry are just being forward thinking), because most if not all of the biologic drugs that are current targets for biosimilar competition have long since lost their regulatory exclusivity.  This change in the law will do little to nothing to affect biosimilar availability for many years.  And yet the drumbeat has been pounding from before the BPCIA was passed (see ""Snatching Defeat from the Jaws of Victory?"").
 
The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) not unexpectedly is opposed to the bill, saying in a statement by federal government relations Senior Vice President Jeanne Haggerty that the change in the law ""would disrupt the careful balance, created by Congress with broad, bipartisan support [in the BPCIA] between the need to encourage investment in innovative, groundbreaking biological therapies and the desire to ensure that patients have increased choices offered by biosimilar products after a reasonable period of exclusivity for the innovator product.""  And Ms. Haggerty noted that the bill would trade short-term price reductions for the risk of inhibiting investment in these drugs, which typically have high development and regulatory compliance costs.
 
In our economic system there is always a balance between the amount of risk an investment carries and the size and likelihood of the return on investment.  The only peer-reviewed study of this question for biologic drugs recommended (at the time the exclusivity provisions were being debated) that about 17 years was the necessary exclusivity term (see ""Professor Grabowski's Economic Analysis of Data Exclusivity for Follow-on Biologic Drugs"").  The 12-year term represents a compromise between a variety of proposals, including the 7 year term the Obama administration is so enamored with and the Federal Trade Commission's proposal that there be no exclusivity term (reminding us that things could be much worse) (see ""No One Seems Happy with Follow-on Biologics According to the FTC"").
 
It is unlikely that this bill will move to passage in the 114th Congress, in view of the limited time left in the session, the impending Congressional and Presidential elections, and the general failure of Congress to pass legislation over the past few years.  But it is likely in equal measure that this bill will be back in the 115th Congress and whether it passes or not will depend on the outcome of these elections.  Vote accordingly.",,,07/08/16 09:53 AM
27016,1105879,Cleveland Offshore Wind Farm Project Awarded $40 Million DOE Grant,06/28/16,8,"By Josh Marks
Could the Rust Belt turn into the Wind Belt? The Great Lakes represent 20 percent of the United States' total offshore wind energy capacity, but not a single wind turbine has yet to be seen. That could start to change soon thanks to a $40 million grant from the Department of Energy for North America's first offshore freshwater wind farm, located on Lake Erie about eight to 10 miles northwest of downtown Cleveland, Ohio. The funding was awarded to Lake Erie Energy Development Corporation (LEEDCo) for its ""Icebreaker"" project that will consist of six 3.45 megawatt turbines (20.7 MW).
 
""Lake Erie is the Saudi Arabia of wind, and today's award should be a gusher for northern Ohio,"" Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09) said in a recent statement. ""This wind power project will begin to unleash Lake Erie's full renewable power potential and contribute to creating a more competitive energy marketplace. LEEDCo's innovative vision can help transform energy production and distribution for northern Ohio's residents and thousands of businesses. Because Lake Erie serves both the U.S. and Canada this development also harkens toward a future that could link Ohio and Ontario in a new energy partnership.""
 
Acccording to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, LEEDCo's decision to adopt the European-designed ""Mono Bucket"" foundation, which ""eliminates pile driving in the bedrock below the lake bed,"" might have played a role in DOE's decision to fully fund the project. The total cost of the project is estimated to be around $120 million. In addition to previous federal grants totalling $10 million, Fred Olsen Renewables, the largest independent power producer in the United Kingdom, is expected to raise the remaining $70 million.
 
The nation's first offshore wind farm is on schedule for completion later this year. The Block Island Wind Farm is located in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Rhode Island. The 30-megawatt, five-turbine project is expected to produce more than 125,000 megawatt hours annually. The Lake Erie offshore wind farm is expected to be completed and operational by the end of 2018.",,,07/08/16 09:58 AM

U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is beating the drum for more money for Zika virus research at a Fort Collins lab.

Bennet, a Colorado Democrat up for re-election in November, wrote a letter to leaders in both chambers of Congress to request immediate emergency funding to fight the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, located at the foothills campus of Colorado State University, is ""at the forefront of these efforts,"" Bennet wrote.

""Congress must pass additional funding before research slows to a halt,"" Bennet wrote. ""With the upcoming summer and advent of the 2016 Olympics in Brazil, we need to intensify our efforts to ensure we are doing everything possible to protect our citizens.""

President Barack Obama has asked for $1.9 billion in emergency funding to fight the mosquito-born disease, but the request has floundered in Congress.

Zika has been linked to serious birth defects and a neurological disorder that stems from an immune system attack. While there have been zero reported cases of Zika being contracted from a mosquito in the U.S., 472 U.S. residents have contracted the virus while traveling outside the country.

Two cases have been identified in Colorado.

""Colorado families are rightfully concerned with the spread of Zika, particularly with the onset of summer and mosquito season,"" Bennet said in a written statement. ""Researchers at the CDC facility in Fort Collins are working hard to help combat the virus and prevent it from spreading further. Congress should quickly approve this additional funding to ensure this crucial research will continue.""",,,07/08/16 10:47 AM
561,1106081,"The Denver Post- Supporters Urge Lawmakers To ""Not Stand Idly"" On Gun Control",06/26/16,8,"By Natalie Munio

After a day-long sit-in protest on the floor of the House of Representatives over gun control, U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette brought the battle back home to Colorado for a rally on the steps of the Denver City and County Building on Sunday.

""Every time there's a shooting, we have a moment of silence in Congress, and I pray for the victims and their families,"" DeGette said. ""But you know what? A moment of silence is not enough.""

Sunday's event came on the heels of the rebellious and unruly sit-in, a cry of protest to demand voting on gun-control bills, which eventually led to the House adjourning until after the July 4 holiday.

DeGette, a Democrat, reiterated that frustration Sunday as she addressed the cry for stricter gun-control legislation by calling on the immediate need to ""tighten loopholes"" in background checks for purchasing guns, the need to reinstate the assault-weapon ban and to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun-related violence. 

""The parents of Columbine, the parents of Aurora, the parents of Colorado Springs and all across the country demand no less,"" DeGette said. She urged constituents to get involved in the fight by ""calling their members of Congress"" and voting on the issue in November.

Eileen McCarron, president of Colorado Ceasefire Legislative Action, joined in DeGette's sentiments, often alluding to a biblical verse that states one should not ""stand idly by"" while a ""neighbor's blood is shed"" when discussing the level of inaction from federal lawmakers following gun violence in the past.

""Who are our neighbors? Our neighbors are the people praying in a church in Charleston, who welcomed a person in with open arms, not realizing that his hate was armed,"" McCarron said. ""And our leaders just stood idly by.""

McCarron also commended Democratic U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter for ""sitting down rather than standing idly"" during the 25-hour sit-in protest, and she acknowledged Colorado's ""quick action"" for changing state legislation in the wake of tragedy.

""After 13 were killed in Columbine, Colorado voters closed the loophole. After 12 were killed in the Aurora shooting nearly 10 miles away, we enacted universal background checks,"" McCarron said. ""Since then, thousands of individuals have been prevented from buying guns because of background checks; 76 of them had been convicted of homicide. We need to do likewise in Congress.""

Jane Dougherty, who had a personal tie to gun violence, set a different tone when she spoke Sunday. Dougherty's sister, Mary Sherlach, was a psychologist at Sandy Hook Elementary School and was killed in the 2012 shooting. 

Dougherty said lawmakers needed to take note of the quick action and bravery her sister displayed when she and another colleague risked their lives to save many others that day by confronting the gunman in the school lobby.

""My sister Mary took the most selfless act imaginable. It's time for elected officials to also be selfless and end the carnage, or we will find new leaders who will,"" Dougherty said. ""I demand a vote for Mary.""

Dougherty said the lawmakers honored her sister and the many victims of gun violence when they participated in the 25-hour filibuster but that continued action will be the only way to change the national dialogue surrounding gun violence.

""People have thought for a long time: ""It can't happen to me. It can't happen in a town like mine.' But I don't know that they can ever think that anymore,"" Dougherty said. ""We've become numb. Now it's ""another shooting.' They're just one after the other. We need to ask: ""Do I want my town to become just another one of those in a list?' """,,,07/08/16 11:27 AM
561,1106094,The Denver Post- Diana DeGette Handily Defeats Rare Primary Opponent For Democratic Nod For Congress,06/29/16,8,"By Jon Murray 

Every two years, Diana DeGette easily emerges from the Democratic primary as the virtual shoo-in for yet another term representing Denver in Congress.

That happened again Tuesday night despite a rare challenge from within her party. Early returns at 7:15 p.m. showed DeGette garnering nearly 87 percent of the vote against challenger Charles H. ""Chuck"" Norris. The Associated Press quickly called the race.

The primary challenge by the geologist emerged amid consternation by local anti-establishment backers of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Norris won a spot on the ballot at the 1st Congressional District assembly in a year when DeGette is heartily backing Hillary Clinton as a party superdelegate. In the state's Democratic caucus in March, Sanders crushed Clinton, winning in DeGette's district by 14 percentage points.

It was DeGette's first contested primary since 2002. She said she took it seriously.

""As these results show, I have a lot of support from Bernie Sanders supporters,"" DeGette said Tuesday night. ""I respect that and I welcome that support, because I think that issues like income inequality, campaign finance reform and climate change are issues I've been fighting for years on in Congress.""
U.S. House Results

DeGette, 58, is seeking an 11th term in Congress. In November, she will face Republican Charles ""Casper"" Stockham.

Norris, 68, didn't come close to countering DeGette in fundraising. But he tried to rally support for change in Congress, arguing that sending the same incumbents back repeatedly was doing little to change the political system.

""I did everything I could with what I had,"" Norris said, citing his main campaign arguments in favor of diminishing the role of money in politics, taking on climate change and the need for a public health care system. ""I think I was successful, at least, in changing some of the dialogue.""

DeGette attempted in their only face-to-face debate last month to point out how close they were on many issues. She defended her advocacy for Democratic issues, including abortion rights and gun safety, and her effort to pass a bill through the House that would speed up biomedical research.

Two years ago, DeGette won re-election with nearly 66 percent of the vote. In November, she faces Stockham, a radio host, author and former president of American Conservatives of Color.

Through June 8, DeGette had raised more than $900,000 and still had $244,757 in cash on hand. Norris, who said he wouldn't accept donations from political action committees or corporate interests, had raised just $12,523, including a $4,000 loan from himself, while Stockham had raised $20,000. Both men had exhausted most of their funds.

46034,1106127,Another Step Forward for National Institutes of Health Funding,07/08/16,8,"By Nora Kelly
Following in their Senate colleagues' footsteps, a House subcommittee signed off on a budget increase for the National Institutes of Health Thursday. The increases for fiscal-year 2017 confirm lawmakers' public pledges to establish a pattern of improved budgets for the agency, which before last year saw more than a decade of flat funding.
 
The House figure--$1.25 billion, for a total agency budget of $33.3 billion--is lower than the Senate's $2 billion allocation, and lawmakers will eventually negotiate a final budget number in the months to come. But Representative Tom Cole, who heads the labor and health and human services subcommittee that proposed the increase, said he's willing to go higher. ""I view the mark we set forth today as a floor, not as a ceiling, for biomedical-research funding, and I'm hopeful this number can increase as the process moves forward,"" Cole said.
 
It wouldn't be the first time House lawmakers agreed to a higher figure for the NIH. For fiscal-year 2016, the House originally proposed a $1.1 billion increase, but the Senate's $2 billion proposal is what the NIH received.
 
The subcommittee's proposed budget, which it released Wednesday, also includes dedicated increases for the Obama administration's BRAIN Initiative and Alzheimer's disease research; about $580 million to fight the opioid epidemic; and money to combat Zika--which is notable as legislators have been fighting over Zika funding since winter, when President Obama first requested $1.9 billion for research and other measures. As Morning Consult reports:

    The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] would also receive $390 million for the Zika virus. House Republicans have advocated for responding to the virus through the appropriations process, though a $1.1 billion deal in currently stalled in the Senate. The bill also proposes $300 million for a new Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund, which would allow the CDC director to immediately access money during a public health crisis.

Aware that Zika funding had languished in Congress for months, Cole had previously promised dedicated Zika money in his subcommittee's bill. And though he made good on that promise, Democrats don't think any of the Republican-backed measures for Zika are enough, and they disagree with moving Zika funding through the appropriations process and not marking it as emergency funding. Nevertheless, as STAT reports, some top Democrats support the reserve fund at least, because it ""could help prevent future standoffs"" over funding allocations.
 
Lawmakers politely argued over the specifics on Zika funding during the meeting, and Democrats seemed generally dissatisfied with the budget bill, which Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro said includes ""devastating cuts"" to educational and family-planning programs, among others, and continues to block gun-violence research at the CDC. But when it came to funding the NIH, which currently hasbroad bipartisan support, lawmakers really had nothing to debate about.",,,07/08/16 11:51 AM

Two Democrats landed on the ticket Friday night to run for the congressional seat held by Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn, the incumbent who is himself in a surprising primary.

A Democrat has never held the 5th Congressional District seat, but the candidates nominated Friday night seemed undaunted by those odds.

And perhaps bolstered by the fact Lamborn, R-Colorado Springs, is going to be the second name in his primary race because Calandra Vargas, 32, beat him at the Republican assembly last Friday in Colorado Springs.

""It's just proof that he needs to go,"" Donald E. Martinez said. ""We need a young voice, a fresh voice, someone more in touch with the district.""

Misty Plowright, 33, said she wasn't surprised that Lamborn is facing another primary.

""He's pretty much universally reviled,"" Plowright said.

Plowright and Martinez split the vote nearly in half. Because both got more than 30 percent of the vote, there will be a primary.

Martinez, 36, is a single dad raising two daughters, ages 7 and 9, in Colorado Springs.

He's a combat veteran from Iraq who said he decided to run when he had issues with the local VA hospital and called Lamborn's office.

""There are too many veterans in his district for him to help them all,"" Martinez said. ""I was speechless and felt betrayed.""

Plowright is a transgender woman who lives in Colorado Springs with her wife, Lisa. She said that while equality for all is important to her, her platform isn't based on a single issue.

""I'm the anti-politician,"" she said. ""Look at how I'm dressed.""

She wore one of her campaign T-shirts, a bright purple shirt with her name over a mountain range and ""Let's Plowright into Congress"" on the back.

""Until we get private money out of politics entirely, nothing is going to change.""

She has worked for more than a decade in IT,and wants to increase access to high-speed broadband Internet throughout the U.S.

Hensarling spent time at the Austin Bank hearing about the strain Dodd-Frank has put on the bank's customers and their community. 

""The undeniable truth is the economy still isn't working like it could and should for East Texans,"" he said, noting that ""many remain stuck in the slowest and weakest economic recovery of their lifetimes.

""One of the biggest reasons for this is the ""one size fits all' regulations found in the Obama Financial Control Law that harm consumers and suffocate their hometown banks and credit unions,"" Hensarling explained. ""The climate of uncertainty created by these excessive regulations are harming our economy and destroying opportunities for growth.""

Jacksonville resident Mike McEwen, who owns Cherokee Real Estate, shared firsthand knowledge of the impact of the Obama Financial Control Law.

 ""I've been involved in real estate since 1989, and was in the retail business 21 years prior to that,"" said McEwen.  ""I think Dodd-Frank made a step in the right direction in terms of addressing fraud in the home lending industry. But unfortunately, it also implemented procedures that have complicated the purchase process from beginning to end -- creating frustration for the buyer, the lender, real estate professionals and the companies that conduct real estate closings.

""Professionals from all parts of the country have voiced their frustration. For those of us who work in rural parts of Texas, the process can be even more exasperating,"" McEwen added.

""Homeownership has always been considered part of the American dream and many of the needless restraints in Dodd-Frank have made achieving that dream a greater obstacle. This entire piece of legislation needs to be reevaluated with the goals of keeping the home-buying process above-board and making the purchase of a home a more achievable objective for those who want to live the American dream,"" he said.

Hensarling agreed.

""Unfortunately, Mike is not alone in his experience,"" he said . ""Since the law was implemented, I've heard from countless Americans across my district and the country that are no longer able to access the financial products their families have come to rely on. The harmful consequences of the Obama Financial Control Law are all too real. Greater regulation leads to increased regulatory costs, which leads to increased bank costs, which leads to an increase in costs to the consumer.""

The congressman noted how drastic hikes in credit card rates make them ""unaffordable and unavailable for many would-be borrowers. Federal regulations on auto loans could hit some borrowers hard, with a nearly $600 increase in interest payments on a $25,000 loan over a four-year period, small businesses are still struggling for access to credit and the incredible regulatory burden placed on homebuyers has complicated the buying process and led to fewer community banks offering mortgages.

""The fact that these higher costs are taking place while paychecks and savings are stagnant is compounding the problem,"" he added ""The painful truth is the Washington hyper-controlled economy is failing low and moderate income Americans who simply want their fair shot at economic opportunity and financial security.""

As Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Hensarling said he is working to develop legislation ""that will bring relief to hardworking Americans weighed down by their own government. ""This legislation will protect consumers and allow banks to serve their needs in competitive, transparent, and innovative markets, vigorously policed for force and fraud. It will end taxpayer-funded bailouts and unleash America's entrepreneurial potential. It will provide desperately needed regulatory relief and halt the unbridled growth of the unaccountable, arrogant bureaucracy that is dragging us towards the failed economy of a European-style social democracy,"" he said. ""In short, it will enable banks to provide the financial resources and opportunity East Texans need to achieve their version of the American dream.""",,,07/08/16 01:59 PM
