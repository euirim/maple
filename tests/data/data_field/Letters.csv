1103140,9715,Letter to the Speaker's Organizational Task Force - Reform in Mandatory Spending,05/18/16,2,"I propose to bring mandatory spending under the same congressional control that we currently exercise over discretionary spending.

FIRST: The budget committee, in consultation with committees of jurisdiction, would set overall spending levels for mandatory programs and offer suggestions of how to achieve those levels, as is currently done.

SECOND: Once the budget is enacted, the committees of jurisdiction would prepare statutory changes in mandatory programs to meet the targets set in the budget, just as they do for reconciliation.

THIRD: The statutory changes in mandatory programs reported by the committees of jurisdiction would then be transmitted to the Appropriations Committee, which would incorporate them into the appropriate appropriations bills.

FOURTH: Amendments would be in order on the House floor to modify or supplement these changes to the extent they keep within the enacted budget levels.

FAQs:

How does this differ from reconciliation?   This process is in addition to the existing reconciliation process.  It would place mandatory spending changes directly into the individual appropriations bills to keep within the budget.  Reconciliation would still be available as an expedited process to fill in any gaps between the budget document and current law.

Doesn't this make the Appropriations Committee a giant authorizing committee?  No.  The Appropriations Committee simply fulfills a ministerial function of incorporating the changes from the authorizing committees into the relevant appropriations bills.  It passes them through in the same manner as the Budget Committee passes through statutory changes reported by authorizing committees during reconciliation.

Couldn't the Senate strip out these provisions?   Yes, and these differences would be resolved at conference, just as any other differences between the houses.  Reconciliation would remain available to fill in any gaps.

Doesn't this complicate the already difficult process of adopting appropriations bills?  Yes and no.  Additional provisions often bring additional controversies -- but they also can bring additional support.  It may actually make the process easier, because it would allow increases in discretionary spending to be offset by decreases in mandatory spending in the same bill, offering broader ground for consensus.  And clearly, it would make adoption of the budget easier because it offers much greater flexibility in trading discretionary and mandatory spending levels. 

How would this work on the floor?  Statutory changes could be amended in the same manner as any other provision of the appropriations bills, but would only be in order to the extent that the changes are necessary to meet the spending targets already agreed to in the enacted budget.

What rules changes would be required? House Rule XXI (2)(b) would need to be modified to allow these statutory changes to be included in appropriations bills, and a provision should be added to the House rules that specifies this process.  It would not require Senate action or presidential approval.",,,07/05/16 03:23 PM
1103143,9715,Letter to the Speaker's Organizational Task Force - Reform in Unauthorized Appropriations,05/18/16,2,"I propose to restore the House ban on unauthorized spending through a conference rule that includes the following provisions:

FIRST:  To direct all authorizing committees to identify any expired or soon to expire programs within their jurisdictions and to adopt a timetable for adopting legislation reauthorizing them.

SECOND: To direct the authorizing committees in this process:

     1.    Except for trust fund programs, to remove all possible mandatory spending provisions, and to require all revenues derived from these programs to be deposited in the Treasury and subject to annual congressional appropriation.

     2.    To remove all legislative and judicial authority ceded to the executive agencies in the program authorizations.  NO agency rule should have force of law without being enacted by Congress, and ALL legal disputes arising from these laws should be adjudicated by the federal courts and not by administrative agencies.
 
THIRD: To direct the Rules Committee members not to report any rule to the floor that waives a point of order on Rule XXI (2)(a) on any appropriations bill for a program that has not been reauthorized after the deadline set by the authorizing committee timetables, unless otherwise requested in writing by the chairman of the relevant committee of jurisdiction AND the chairman of the relevant Appropriations subcommittee.

FOURTH: To direct the Appropriations Committee members not to appropriate above the prior year's appropriation for any program that  has not been reauthorized after the deadlines set by the authorizing committee timetables, unless otherwise requested in writing by the chairman of the relevant committee of jurisdiction AND the chairman of the relevant Appropriations subcommittee.

FAQ's

Won't this clog the committees with reauthorizing bills?  No, because the committees will set their own timetables based on their own estimates of work load and priorities and can alter these timetables if necessary.

What happens if the reauthorization fails?  Two things.  The Appropriations Committee would not approve funding above the prior year's level for that program, and the Rules Committee would expose that appropriation to a point of order -- unless the chairmen of the authorizing committee and the appropriations subcommittee both agreed to do otherwise.  

Wouldn't this jeopardize vital programs like the State Department and the Coast Guard?  No, the Rules Committee could still waive a point of order IF requested by the chairmen of both the relevant committee of jurisdiction AND the Appropriations subcommittee.  The House could also exercise its will to override the point of order on the floor if a majority were so inclined.

Doesn't this hamstring the Rules and Appropriations Committee members?  When it comes to setting the agenda of the House, the Rules Committee members serve as a ministerial arm of the Republican Conference, and this rule would direct them in exercising this responsibility on behalf of the Conference.  The Appropriations Committee members would be no more constrained under this provision than they already are not to enact appropriations above the 302(a) level.   

What happens if the Senate approves funding for an unauthorized program after the deadline for reauthorization?  The differences would be resolved in a conference committee, and conference reports are not subject to Rule XXI(2)(a).    

What rules changes would be required?  This reform could be enacted by a simple rule of the House Republican Conference, in the same manner as we currently ban earmarks.",,,07/05/16 03:25 PM
1103186,123732,"Letter to the Hon. Julian Castro, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development- Arizona Continuum of Care Allocations",06/10/16,2,"Dear Secretary Castro:

We write to you regarding the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) recent announcement of FY2015 Tier 2 Continuum of Care (CoC) allocation in Arizona.

While we support increased competition in the CoC allocation process, due to limited funds, several Arizona-based housing organizations did not receive funding. This has resulted in the unfortunate and imminent displacement of 67 families in Maricopa County if a short-term solution is not found.

As you know, CoC funds are used to target homelessness in communities by providing assistance to homeless individuals and families to obtain both transitional and permanent housing. In the past, due to the timing of funding decisions, some housing organizations regularly incurred expenses for a portion of the year on the assumption that they would cover their expenses after their funding requests were ultimately approved by HUD. It is our understanding that two Standing Strong For Families groups, House of Refuge and Labors Community Service Agency, did not receive adequate notice that CoC funding would be terminated and leaving little time to mitigate their shortfall of funds and relocate families. Furthermore, wait lists for existing programs in Arizona are already at capacity and there is no ability to absorb these additional families being displaced by the affected programs. 

In light of this impending housing problem, we request that HUD work with these housing organizations to identify any existing resources to prevent the 67 Arizona families from returning to homelessness. We respectfully ask that HUD reviews this request for feasibility and further recommendation in a manner consistent with existing rules and regulations.

We thank you for your attention to this matter and look forward to your timely response. Should you have additional questions please contact Gina Gormley with Senator McCain via Gina_Gormley@mccan.senate.gov or (602) 952-2410.",,,07/05/16 03:38 PM
1103193,28253,"Letter to Jason Chaffetz, Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; Elijah Cumming, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform- Grijalva Works to Prevent Cherrybell Closure in Postal Reform",06/23/16,2,"Dear Mr. Chaffetz and Mr. Cummings,

I appreciate your work on drafting the Postal Service Reform Act of 2016 and I write today to encourage you to include strong language to prevent unnecessary postal service consolidations in any final product. A strong and vibrant postal service is a critical part of our economy and immediate legislative relief is necessary to retain a responsive, quality postal service in this nation.

I am concerned that the draft legislation will not sufficiently protect postal facilities from unwarranted consolidation, including the Cherrybell Processing and Distribution Center in my district. The closure of Cherrybell would leave one of the nation's fastest growing population centers with only one processing facility, adversely impacting consumers and the business community. The partial consolidation of the Tucson center has already harmed individuals, businesses, and mailers in the community with delivery delays. A 2015 Tucson city survey found that 84 percent of individuals and 86 percent of businesses reported a noticeable delay in their mail delivery services since the first phase of consolidation and respondents reported waiting additional days for medicines, delays in Veterans benefits and medications and delays in receipts and payments for regular business transactions. 

Specifically, to prevent degradation in mail service and secure the future of the Postal Service, service standards should be restored to 2012 levels. The 2012 cut in standards has caused a drastic slowdown in mail processing. Additionally, there should be language that enacts a minimum of a two year moratorium on closures. The intended cost cutting measures of consolidation have not materialized and have actually lost the Postal Services $66 million in fiscal year 2015. [i]

The bill should also include comprehensive requirements to update the feasibility studies used to propose consolidating, as the current process has been entirely inadequate. Furthermore, there is a need for greater transparency in the postal consolidation process, and a method for communities to appeal determinations made by the USPS. Finally, the bill language must ensure that ""postal processing and distribution centers', such as Cherrybell in Tucson, are included in the definitions section so that there is no ambiguity.

The United States Postal Service is critical to small businesses, millions of Americans' jobs and is especially important to rural areas across the country. Postal delays are not merely a nuisance, but can be costly in terms of health impacts and businesses' most fundamental operations, such as meeting their payroll. It is vital that any reform bill includes clear language to prevent harmful consolidations. 

I appreciate you accepting my comments and would like to offer my staff's assistance in working on specific language for the legislation for each of the issues raised above.",,,07/05/16 03:41 PM

I am writing regarding the rapidly growing wildfire (the ""Cedar Creek Fire"") near the communities of Show Low, Pinetop-Lakeside, and the White Mountain Apache Reservation in Arizona. I urge you to mobilize all necessary resources to contain this wildfire.                                                                                            

The Cedar Creek fire started yesterday afternoon and has already grown to more than 3,000 acres. Evacuations and pre-evacuations have been ordered for a number residents in the area.    

This fire is burning in a region of the state that is at high risk of wildfire. Two of Arizona's largest wildfires in history have occurred in the area: the Wallow Fire in 2011 (538,049 acres) and the Rodeo-Chediski Fire in 2002 (468,638 acres). With dry and windy conditions forecast, I am deeply concerned over the potential for the Cedar Creek Fire to inflict catastrophic damage to human life and property in this area.

1103312,26759,"Letter to the Honorable Jacob J. Lew Secretary of the Treasury and Dr. Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank - Labor Standards",06/24/16,2,"We write to express our appreciation for the energy and thoughtfulness with which the Department of Treasury has engaged on the issue of the World Bank's effort to update its social and environmental safeguard policies. We also write to express our strong concern in one particular area, and while this is our most pressing concern, we do not mean to suggest that this is the only area that we think needs attention before the revised environmental and social safeguard framework is adopted.
Specifically, with respect to the Environmental and Social Standard, ESS2, on Labor and Working Conditions, we are concerned that some of the improvements that took place between the first and second drafts of the World Bank's revised safeguards policy, respectively dated July 2014 and July 2015, may be rolled back in the third draft, which has not yet been made public.

The improvements made in the second draft included extension of coverage to contracted workers; measures to guard against problems of child labor, forced labor and dangerous working conditions in the supply chain; and improved language to protect workers' freedom of association.

We understand that some of these provisions may be substantially diluted in the third draft. For example, the borrower who is informed of the existence of child labor, forced labor or dangerous working conditions in the supply chain may have no serious obligation to shift to other suppliers if attempts to remedy the problems with the suppliers are not successful.

With regard to freedom of association and right to collective bargaining, countries would only have to comply with these rights in World Bank projects to the extent required by national law, a proviso that would not apply to the other fundamental workers' rights. These rights are defined in the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (1998), to which all ILO member countries are required to adhere. The other fundamental rights pertain to prohibition of child labor and forced labor and non-discrimination.

Related to these weaknesses is the absence of any reference to ILO standards in ESS2 or elsewhere in the draft policy. The lack of such a reference represents a break from the policies of the other multilateral development banks (MDBs) that have adopted a labor safeguard, notably the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the African Development Bank. All of these explicitly enumerate the eight ILO fundamental rights conventions or refer to the ILO Core Labor Standards.

We are concerned that, by omitting all reference to the recognized international standard-setting body on labor, the ILO, the World Bank would create an unwelcome precedent and weaken a well-established practice dating back more than a decade among other MDBs that have adopted a labor safeguard.

The World Bank should be the leader in adopting, upholding and implementing the highest international environmental and social standards in the activities that it finances, not undermine those adopted by other MDBs. By adopting and applying high standards, the Bank would contribute to sustainable development and avoid harmful and costly impacts. Weak standards or uneven implementation not only cause important social and environmental damages, but they also have sometimes led to significant reputational loss for the Bank and projects that have had to be significantly altered or even cancelled.

We urge the World Bank to ensure that the new environmental and social safeguards policy it will adopt in the coming months meets the highest international standards.

If the Bank falls significantly short in this regard, we will be extremely disappointed, and we fear it may lead to a situation in Congress where it will become increasingly difficult to garner the votes necessary to continue robust U.S. support for the World Bank.

1103317,53270,"Letter to the Hon. Robert McDonald, Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs- Accountability Measures in Veterans Choice Act",06/17/16,2,"Dear Secretary McDonald:

I write to convey serious concern about the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) decision that it will not enforce key provisions in the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 that Congress passed--and the President signed into law--in response to the nationwide wait-time scandal aimed at quickly firing employees engaged in wrongdoing.

My concern is compounded by the fact that your decision was conveyed by a VA staffer to a congressional aide, on that aide's request, in a single-line email late on Friday afternoon. Your decision and how it was transmitted to Congress reflects a contempt for Congress's constitutional oversight prerogative and fails to engender confidence in your leadership at the VA and your efforts to restore its relationship with veterans in need.

Congress expressly included in this law accountability reform measures that empower VA administrators to immediately fire poor-performing employees and employees fired for wrongdoing with no pay during an expedited appeals process. It did so to bring badly needed accountability to the VA in the wake of the scandal in care. As you know, VA audits have found widespread falsification of data to improve performance metrics and secure bonuses--problems that point to systemic and cultural problems that had to be dealt with head-on by holding individuals responsible. These provisions were intended to more effectively and decisively root-out such systemic corruption at the VA and are vital to making sure what happened in Phoenix--and, indeed, around the country--never happen again.

You, your agency--and the President himself--extracted the full benefit of the passage of this law among veterans across the nation who demanded accountability and improved quality of care. Yet now, after the Department of Justice's decision not to defend this law against a challenge by former Phoenix VA Director Sharon Helman, you are unilaterally refusing to enforce key elements of this very law. This decision is unconscionable and outrageous.

By no later than Wednesday, June 22, 2016, please provide the following to me:

1)      A description of the VA's position on its intent to enforce the provisions referred to above.

2)      An explanation of the basis for the VA's position.

3)      A copy of any legal opinion or decision memorandum from, among others, the Department of Justice and the VA's general counsel, that serves as the legal or policy basis of the VA's present position.

4)      An explanation of why, if the Department of Justice or the VA has concluded that these provision are unconstitutional, the President signed the underlying Act into law.

Have no doubt that I will work with my colleagues to use every tool available to Congress--appropriations, litigation, additional reform legislation, or other measures-- to ensure the VA fully complies with the law.",,,07/05/16 04:31 PM

I urge you to quickly reconcile the differences between the approaches taken by both chambers and provide the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) the full amount of funding it needs to fight this disease. Every day we delay in getting a bill signed into law puts more Americans at risk. It's crucial that you appoint a conference committee immediately to tackle this issue.

The politicians in Washington should listen to the experts who spend their entire lives fighting outbreaks like this. Every second counts if we want to protect the public from the devastating impact of this disease.

CDC Director Tom Frieden has said that these funds are urgently needed for the agency to expand its capacity to test for Zika, create mosquito control strategies and accelerate the development of a vaccine. These are common-sense steps that, if taken quickly, can stop this disease from spreading further.  

The cost of delay is unacceptably high. We are seeing the effect of this disease in Florida, where mosquito season has already begun. Currently, Florida has more than a quarter of all U.S. Zika cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said this weekend that mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus are expected to enter the U.S. mainland and begin infecting Americans within the next ""month or so.""

Earlier this year, medical experts at the CDC called for nearly $1.9 billion to fight the spread of Zika. We have already provided $589 million by reallocating unused funds from the Ebola fight. I urge you to fully fund the remainder of the CDC's request and do so quickly. The lives of thousands of infants are at risk. We must act swiftly to prevent a public health catastrophe.",,,07/06/16 08:20 AM
1103462,66247,"Letter to the Honorable Jeff Miller, Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and the Honorable Corrine Brown, Ranking Member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs - Buchanan Condemns ""Gross Injustice"" Against Vietnam Vets",05/27/16,2,"More than four decades ago, hundreds of thousands of our nation's finest men and women in the Armed Forces returned home to their families and friends from Vietnam. But for 90,000 American sailors who served on ships and ports off the coast of Vietnam, commonly referred to as ""Blue Water"" Navy veterans, the war never really ended.

That's because these veterans are being denied health care coverage from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for deadly diseases related to exposure to Agent Orange, a toxic herbicide that was used to kill vegetation and eliminate cover for enemy troops during the Vietnam War.

Tragically, these Vietnam servicemen and women have been told by the VA that they are ineligible for much-needed benefits. Currently, only veterans who served on land in Vietnam are eligible for benefits for illnesses tied to Agent Orange.

The U.S. Air Force sprayed nearly 11 million gallons of the toxic chemical in Vietnam. Exposure to Agent Orange has been linked to devastating illnesses including prostate cancer, Parkinson's disease, respiratory cancers, ischemic heart disease and more.

And while Blue Water veterans have experienced identical diseases to their fellow soldiers who served on land in Vietnam just miles away from them -- they don't have identical coverage.

This situation is particularly frustrating because these veterans were previously covered under the original Agent Orange Act of 1991. This law made it clear that anyone who served in the war -- whether on land or in Vietnam's territorial waters -- was presumed to have been exposed to Agent Orange and should receive VA benefits for illnesses caused by it. 

However, in 2002 the VA decided to strip benefits by limiting coverage to veterans who served on land in Vietnam.

This is unacceptable. They fought and sacrificed just like their fellow soldiers who served on land in Vietnam. Denying them health coverage is a gross injustice. This arbitrary distinction should not be the deciding factor in any veteran's access to VA health care.

As Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I'm urging you to immediately act on the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, bipartisan legislation for these veterans who are suffering from diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure.

Since its creation nearly a century ago, the VA made a sacred promise ""to care for him who shall have borne the battle."" In order to live up to that promise, Congress and the VA need to step up for Blue Water veterans.",,,07/06/16 08:36 AM
1103583,28128,"Letter to the Hon. Dan Ashe, Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service- Lake Havasu Boating Regulations",06/13/16,2,"Dear Director Ashe,

I write regarding the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge Draft Compatibility Determination for Recreational Boating (draft determination) announced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (""USFWS,"" ""Service"") April 12, 2016.  

I was pleased to learn that, in response to public requests, the USFWS held public hearings and extended the comment period for this draft determination. However, I urge USFWS to consider the substantial public opposition that has been voiced and amend this onerous and unclear rule restricting recreational boating.

Lake Havasu and the National Wildlife Refuge are important to the regional economy, and those whose businesses depend on boating, recreation, and tourism would be heavily affected. The draft determination rightly asserts that Lake Havasu is the most utilized boating lake in Arizona, and the Refuge sees as many as 3 million visitors each year. Boating, lake tours, and waterskiing are main attractions on the lake. Furthermore, Lake Havasu City sees visitors that contribute approximately $252.8 million in economic impact through expenditures according to a 2008 survey by the Arizona Office of Tourism. These visitors result in a total of 3,766 direct and indirect jobs in the area. Recreation on the Lake, including Havasu National Wildlife Refuge, is a pillar of the local economy that provides the basis for the livelihood of many Arizonans.

Unfortunately, the new restrictions are vague and confuse the differences between existing and proposed restrictions. Furthermore, USFWS has imposed these new regulations with minimal stakeholder consultation. At a minimum, the Service should have engaged the signatory parties to the 2014 Memorandum of Understanding for the regional administration of Lake Havasu. If given the opportunity, these groups could have provided valuable feedback on the draft determination prior to its publication that may have helped USFWS avoid the current negative public outcry.

I urge the USFWS to take a fresh approach and engage in consultation with local governments, stakeholders, and affected individuals. The stakes for Arizonans who depend on Lake Havasu for their livelihoods are considerable. I appreciate your prompt consideration of this request. As always, I ask that this matter be handled in strict accordance with all agency rules, regulations, and ethical guidelines.",,,07/06/16 09:27 AM

As you assume your role, we write to request your assistance raising a critical water infrastructure issue on the U.S. -- Mexico border in the vicinity of Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora. Unfortunately, problems with stormwater structures at the border are threatening the integrity of infrastructure critical to cross-border trade.

The Grand Tunnel, which conveys stormwater runoff under the critically important Dennis DeConcini Land Port of Entry, is in serious jeopardy of collapsing. Last month, the U.S. International Water and Boundary Commission hosted a meeting that highlighted the urgency of the situation and the challenges of coordination of efforts across overlapping jurisdictions. Further complicating U.S. efforts is the increasing stormwater flow from Mexico that is delivered through deteriorating infrastructure.

Solving this problem will require addressing stormwater in Mexico in addition to shoring up the tunnel on the U.S. side of the border. This pressing issue arises in addition to longstanding problems with a cross-border wastewater conveyance pipe, known as the International Outfall Interceptor, that has been repeatedly threatened by smuggling attempts that can rupture the pipe and contaminate the Santa Cruz River.  A failure of the Grand Tunnel that causes damage or closure of the DeConcini would have dire consequences for crucial cross-border trade. We seek your support in raising this issue with your counterparts in Mexico and urge the two countries to work together in addressing the problem.

1103664,9489,"Letter to Barack Obama, President of the United States- Rep. Huffman, 12 Members of Congress Urge Obama to Limit Environmental Impacts of Lifting the Crude Oil Export Ban",02/12/16,2,"Dear President Obama:

We write to share our concerns regarding the Consolidated Appropriations Act's repeal of the longstanding restriction on the export of crude oil. This provision was included in the Omnibus because Congressional Republicans demanded it, despite opposition from most Democrats. We urge you to use all available executive actions to ensure that the harmful environmental impacts of the repeal of the export ban are contained, that public lands and waters are not harmed by an unchecked rush to expand energy production, and that unrestrained crude oil exports do not undermine ongoing progress on tackling greenhouse gas emissions in the wake of the landmark Paris climate agreement.

We are concerned that over the long term, the lifting of the crude oil export ban could drastically increase domestic production from current baseline levels. The American Petroleum Institute (API), the leading advocate of repealing the ban, forecasts increased domestic production by 500,000 barrels per day by 2020 and 1.2 million barrels per day by 2030. While some argue that this production increase will be offset in terms of emissions by reductions in production elsewhere, OPEC nations have already responded to booming U.S. production by ramping up production in order to protect their market share. Far from having a negligible impact on emissions, the ability to export crude oil on the international market could trigger a race to the bottom that continues our addiction to dirty fossil fuels.

Given the risk of harmful environmental impacts, we respectfully recommend that you direct federal agencies to take all available actions to protect against these undesired implications. At a minimum, we believe these actions should include:

    Ensuring that federally owned lands and waters--the common inheritance of all Americans--are utilized to advance our climate and clean energy goals, not harmed by expanded domestic fossil fuel production. Specifically, we strongly urge you to halt new offshore leases that would endanger fragile ocean ecosystems and the global environment, starting with taking the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans off the table to drilling during ongoing considerations of the next five year plan. We also recommend that the Interior Department and U.S. Forest Service take a hard look at approving new fossil fuel leases and permits on or around sensitive public lands, such as Teshekpuk Lake and Colville River in the Arctic, Desolation Canyon and Alton Mine in Utah, Chaco Canyon and roadless areas in the Santa Fe National Forest in New Mexico, Badger-Two Medicine area in Montana, and Thompson Divide in the White River National Forest in Colorado. It is time to align our nation's energy supply commitments, including management of our federal lands and oceans, with a future powered by clean energy, not more fossil fuels that are driving climate change. As part of this commitment to protecting our public lands, we urge you to continue your ongoing work for full and permanent funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.
    Finalizing new fuel efficiency and carbon pollution standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles at the maximum feasible level. We should build on your administration's record of success of strong fuel efficiency so that we continue to reduce our demand for oil.
    Addressing emissions from increased maritime traffic associated with an expansion of crude oil exports. As you know, the recent COP talks left unchallenged the environmental impact of international maritime emissions. Existing authority to establish and enforce Emission Control Areas should be expanded to require the highest standards for maritime traffic in U.S. waters. We also urge you to work internationally to apply these standards to all maritime traffic.
    Minimizing the risks to communities posed by shipping crude oil by train. As shipments of volatile crude oil by rail have surged in recent years, so has the number of oil train derailments and accidents. The Department of Transportation should strengthen requirements regarding transport of crude oil by train to ensure they are as protective as possible, including strong volatility standards for crude oil and protective speed limits for oil trains traveling through population centers and near sensitive environments
    Fully implementing the proposed rule for methane emission regulations for all domestic oil and natural gas production. The EPA should strengthen and finalized its proposed rule on methane pollution from new sources in the oil and gas sector, and additionally propose a rule to limit methane pollution from existing sources in the same sector. Similarly, BLM should fully implement its proposed rule to regulate methane and other greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas activities on public lands in the year ahead. 
    Working with our international trade partners, utilize all aspects of the Clean Air Act and other statutory authorities to ensure that we are not simply exporting pollution to countries whose refineries do not meet the highest standards of environmental compliance. Federal agencies should work with any countries receiving exported crude oil to ensure that they apply the most stringent refinery regulations possible.

We strongly support your administration's continued work to promote clean energy and control carbon pollution, including your continued support for comprehensive international targets on emissions reductions. We know that the promotion of clean, renewable energy both here and abroad will benefit both our environment and the U.S. economy. We also know that expanded domestic oil production undermines our climate and clean energy goals.  Therefore, we strongly urge you to do all you can to ensure repealing the crude oil export ban neither deepens the negative impact of global greenhouse gas emissions, nor increases degradation of our public lands and oceans. We look forward to working with you to continue protecting America's robust natural heritage and valued environment.",,,07/06/16 10:02 AM
1103675,8297,"Letter to the Honorable Megan G. Brennan, Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service - Flooded Post Offices Must Reopen",06/29/16,2,"Dear Postmaster General Brennan:

As you may know, unprecedented storms have recently devastated many communities in my congressional district in West Virginia. Hundreds of homes, buildings, roads, bridges, and more have been severely damaged or washed away entirely. This is being called a ""once in a thousand years"" event with rainfall of more than a foot in just a few hours.

The destruction from these storms has also forced the closure of many rural post offices due to severe structural damage and extensive flooding. The people in these communities rely on daily access to mail to send and receive essential items like paychecks and medicine -- items that are even more critical in times of disaster.

I ask that you and the United States Postal Service do everything possible to expedite the repair of these post offices and restore full operations as soon as reasonably possible. These post offices are critically important to the communities and the people that they serve, and reopening them would provide a great moral boost to your customers.

As of today, Greenbrier, Nicholas, Kanawha, Clay, Fayette, Monroe, Summers, and Roane counties have been declared federal disaster areas by President Obama, and more counties may soon receive a similar designation. I have seen firsthand how these floods have battered these counties, including the severe damage done to the post office in Charmco in Greenbrier County. It is vital that post offices like Charmco be reopened so citizens can be connected with the outside community. These post offices are essential to helping our people get back on their feet and recover from the aftermath of these tragic storms.

West Virginians are experiencing a true crisis. Our people need your assistance to speed up our recovery. I appreciate your help in advance to reopen these post offices as quickly as possible.

Sincerely,

1103690,26745,"Letter to Penny Pritzker, Secretary of Commerce- Members of California Delegation Push for Federal Disaster Declaration in Crab Fisheries",02/16/16,2,"Dear Secretary Pritzker:

Earlier this week, Governor Jerry Brown wrote to you to request that you declare a fishery resource disaster in the California Dungeness crab and rock crab fisheries under section 308(d) of the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986, and a commercial fishery failure under section 312(a) of the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976. This declaration will allow our communities to receive desperately-needed aid. We write in support of the Governor's request for a disaster declaration, and ask that you work with the state to quickly complete the review process.

The closures of the commercial Dungeness crab fishery and the partial closure of the rock crab fishery are causing severe economic hardship in California's fishing communities. These fisheries are crucial to the coastal economy of central and northern California -- last year, revenue from the sales of Dungeness crabs alone was estimated at just below $60 million.

The cause of the closure, an unprecedented toxic bloom of the marine diatom Pseudo-nitzchia australis, has led to elevated levels of the neurotoxin domoic acid, which persist in the crabs' bodies and in the environment and can be transmitted to humans via the food supply. While we remain hopeful that the toxin levels will continue to fall, our fishermen and coastal communities have already missed out on the most lucrative sales of the year. Many of these fishermen may not be able to catch enough crab this year to make ends meet, and the coastal communities that rely on this important source of revenue are already suffering.

Although the recent lifting of the health advisory for Dungeness crab south of Point Reyes is encouraging, the closure of the fishery has already resulted in lasting negative social and economic effects to fishery stakeholders and coastal communities along the coast of California. The Governor of California estimates that the direct economic impact from the commercial closures to date is at least $48.3 million for Dungeness crab and $376,000 for rock crab, as well as untold losses to other sectors of the fishing industry such as processors and distributors.

Given the severe hardship our constituents are currently experiencing, we urge you to review the Governor's request as expeditiously as possible. Thank you for your consideration.",,,07/06/16 10:12 AM
1103763,53273,"Letter to the Hon. Robert M. Califf, Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration- Update Food Recall Process",06/10/16,2,"Dear Commissioner Califf,

We are writing in response to an early alert issued today by the Department of Health and Human Service's Inspector General on preliminary findings of an audit of the agency's food recall process. We urge you to work quickly to update the agency's recall policy so that it conducts intensified testing and issues recalls more quickly in order to prevent illnesses and deaths.

The Inspector General's preliminary findings detail two foodborne outbreaks in which the agency did not initiate recalls until 165 days and 85 days after it became aware of a public health risk to consumers linked to a regulated food product. We understand that the agency has issued many voluntary recalls in a timely fashion and is working to update its food safety policies pursuant to the Food Safety Modernization Act. These findings are still deeply concerning and we ask that you work swiftly to improve the agency's outbreak investigation and recall processes.

We are also concerned for those instances where the agency did not issue a recall during the course of an outbreak linked to a regulated product. For example, in 2013, 2014, and 2015 there were large multistate Cyclospora outbreaks that were linked to cilantro imports from Mexico and similar seasonal and geographic patterns. In total, these outbreaks were linked to 1,481 infections. However, in each of these three outbreaks, no recall was ever issued. Failure to issue any recall puts Americans at risk.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's investigation of the 2014 outbreak, your agency did not begin to conduct intensified testing of cilantro imports from Mexico until August, 28, 2014. This is in spite of the fact that the majority of illnesses in this outbreak were reported in June and July. Given the similar 2013 outbreak, it is our view that the agency had justification to being more immediate intensified testing of cilantro in 2014. We appreciate that the agency has issued an import alert for cilantro produced in a specific region of Mexico to help prevent further outbreaks. However, we ask that you also carefully review how these three outbreak investigations were handled and determined what improvements can be made to the agency's processes.

Thank you for your attention to our request. We look forward to your response.",,,07/06/16 10:38 AM
1103797,53273,"Letter to the Hon. Deborah Lee James, Secretary of the Air Force- Delay Retiring U-2 Spy Plane",06/20/16,2,"Dear Secretary James:

We write today to urge the Air Force to defer the retirement of the U-2 aircraft in order to prevent a possible gap in high altitude Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) collection beyond FY2019.

As you know, demand by Combatant Commanders for ISR is increasing. At the same time, current Defense Department plans call for the retirement of the U-2 in 2019 with no plan that we are aware of to replace lost ISR capacity.

We understand that the U-2 fleet has almost 80% of its airframe life remaining, making it sustainable well beyond FY2019. Retirement of the U-2 in the coming years is expected to result in a reduction in high altitude ISR capacity, including the loss of the U-2's unique intelligence gathering capabilities.

Rather than seeking to retire the U-2, we encourage the Air Force to consider continuing to fly a mixed fleet of both U-2 and Global Hawk aircraft to prevent a gap in both capability and capacity. While we appreciate your support for near-term capability upgrades to the U-2's radar and sensors, further investment in the aircraft is limited due to its retirement date. Deferring the retirement of the U-2 would also allow the Air Force time to plan for follow-on systems capable of meeting the full spectrum of high altitude ISR requirements well into the future.

In conclusion, we urge the Air Force to defer the retirement of the U-2 in order to ensure that our Combatant Commanders have the ISR they require.",,,07/06/16 10:55 AM
1103826,26904,Letter to Senate and House Conferees - Murphy Renews Push For Full Emergency Zika Funding As Florida Surpasses 200 Cases,06/22/16,2,"We respectfully write to request that the members of the conference committee support and provide the administration's full supplemental Zika funding request of $1.9 billion.

As you know, the Zika virus is a serious threat in the United States and abroad.  Already, more than 2,000 Americans in the continental United States and territories have been infected.  Of those, 423 are pregnant women.  As we have seen throughout Central and South America and other Zika-affected regions, those numbers will grow, as will the number of children born with microcephaly.

This urgency is seen most clearly within the public health infrastructure and infectious disease research communities.  Each day, our offices receive pleas from every level of government and private institutions for the necessary resources to better understand the Zika virus and prevent its transmission.  These pleas increase each day as we move closer to summer when rain and heat create the optimal environment for the Aedes aegypti mosquito.  Additionally, at research institutions across the country, leading scientists are working to unlock the virus's transmission, develop better testing systems, and ultimately deliver a vaccine.  These serious efforts require an equally serious investment without delay.

The United States has a proud tradition of leading the world in public health and infectious disease research. We respectfully implore you to heed the pleas of our constituents and medical experts and provide the full $1.9 billion request to combat Zika.",,,07/06/16 11:06 AM
1103870,137652,"Letter to Gina McCarthy, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency - Murphy Calls For Epa Assistance With St. Lucie River, Indian River Lagoon Water Quality Testing",06/27/16,2,"The 18th Congressional District is in the midst of an ecological disaster.  Nutrient-laden discharges from Lake Okeechobee coupled with local basin run-off have altered the most biodiverse estuary in America, the Indian River Lagoon.  Home to more than 4,000 species of plants and animals, including dozens of threatened and endangered species, dolphins, pelicans, and one-third of America's manatee population, the Indian River Lagoon is a national treasure under assault.  Due to historic El Niño-fueled rainfall, polluted discharges unusually began in the dry season and continue into the wet season.  In fact, the Army Corps has discharged more freshwater into the brackish Indian River Lagoon this year than in all of 2013 when the ""Lost Summer"" wreaked environmental havoc on the Treasure Coast.

Last month, residents and environmental scientists began noticing blue-green algae.  These blooms harm the economy and tourism, threaten wildlife, and pose a number of health risks when deemed toxic.  While the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is reporting toxicity in blue-green algae throughout the ecosystem, underfunding and lack of capacity is leaving many of the reported blooms untested, according to recent media reports.  Those who call this area home are angry and frustrated.  We have a right to know what is in our water.

While the State of Florida is ultimately responsible for our water quality, my constituents cannot wait.  As our state leaders continue to squander voter-directed Amendment 1 conservation dollars, the need for the state's commitment to conservation and clean water could not be more urgent.  Therefore, I strongly request the EPA provide technical and financial assistance to Florida DEP to increase water quality testing.  Additionally, I request EPA conduct an independent assessment of the water quality in our region, including Lake Okeechobee, the St.  Lucie River, and the Indian River Lagoon, as well as assessing the toxicity of large, blue-green algae blooms throughout the ecosystem.  Your actions as Administrator demonstrate that you share my passion for clean water.  For the health and safety of the people I represent and for the vitality of one of our nation's most important estuaries, I implore your assistance on this urgent and sadly predictable environmental disaster.",,,07/06/16 11:25 AM
1103882,137652,"Letter to the Honorable Rick Scott, Governor of the State of Florida - Murphy To Scott: Declare State Of Emergency",06/29/16,2,"Toxic, blue-green algae is choking the Indian River Lagoon and the Caloosahatchee River.  The algal blooms are wreaking havoc on our nation's most precious ecosystems and significantly threatening public health and safety.  Meanwhile, our wildlife, tourism, and small businesses hang in the balance.

When residents and environmental scientists began noticing blue-green algae throughout our ecosystem last month, our community predicted the necessary conditions would present themselves to cause a significant decline in water quality and lead to toxic algae. Regrettably, this disaster has come to pass with harmful algal blooms inundating our waterways and beaches.

Matters are so dire that officials in Martin County called an emergency meeting with residents, and less than 24 hours later, hundreds of residents were lined up to voice their concerns, frustrations, and anger at the lack of state action to address this ongoing crisis.

I stand with Floridians who demand clean water and who have the right to know what is in our waterways.  All levels of government should be working together to provide the necessary resources to assist the residents, businesses, and ecosystems impacted by this crisis.

I join the Martin County Board of County Commissioners in requesting an emergency declaration from the State of Florida and urge you to view the situation firsthand.  As the region's representative to the federal government, I will continue to fight for federal assistance and a sustained commitment to ultimately move more clean water south to provide relief to local waterways.",,,07/06/16 11:29 AM
1103894,67151,"Letter to the Honorable Rick Scott, Governor of the State of Florida - Murphy, Florida Democrats Call On State To Do Its Part In Fighting Zika",06/30/16,2,"Thank you for your recent efforts to convince Republican congressional leaders to provide full funding to tackle the Zika crisis.  With more than 220 cases in Florida and, tragically, the first baby affected by Zika-related microcephaly born in Florida this week, the need for immediate congressional action could not be more clear.  Given your interest in the issue, we have two suggestions for how your administration could do its part to fight Zika.

Expand Medicaid.  As you are well aware, over 1.2 million Floridians have no access to affordable health care because your administration has failed to expand Medicaid.  On June 1, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued guidance to all states on the use of Medicaid funds to prevent, detect, and respond to the Zika virus, including coverage for mosquito repellent.  Unfortunately, working Florida citizens in the Medicaid gap will be unable to access this very basic preventative measure, along with routine health care screenings and emergency care.  Additionally, because the state has foregone $5.9 billion in Medicaid funding in FY2016 alone, many community health centers and county departments of health lack the funding resources to meet the needs of low-income Floridians once local Zika transmission occurs.  Join the overwhelming majority of Floridians -- including patient advocates, community and religious leaders, business groups, health care providers and plans, and economists -- and accept existing federal dollars to strengthen Medicaid for Florida.

End the War on Women.  We find it incomprehensible that your administration would move forward with restricting Medicaid and Title X family planning dollars to health care providers that offer comprehensive reproductive care, including Planned Parenthood.  Because the Zika virus can be sexually transmitted and is known to cause microcephaly and other severe birth defects, the urgent need for family planning could not be more clear.  As Zika threatens public health in our state, your administration's crusade against women's health will exacerbate the problem.  According to the New England Journal of Medicine, states that have blocked Title X and Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood are seeing significant reductions in the use of birth control and increases of unintended pregnancies. While any individual can contract Zika, pregnant women and women who may become pregnant are the most vulnerable.  We urge you in the strongest possible terms to issue an emergency executive order to preserve thousands of Floridians' access to birth control, family planning, and other reproductive care through Title X and Medicaid. 

With the devastating effects of the Zika virus already in our state and a possible vaccine still months or even years away from development, these actions are not only good policy but also the right thing to do.  As we work to provide the State of Florida with full federal funding to address this crisis, we hope you will do your part before the crisis becomes insurmountable.",,,07/06/16 11:34 AM
