128028,1038061,Budget Address,02/02/16,1,"Good evening, Speaker Mattiello, Senate President Paiva Weed, Members of the General Assembly, distinguished guests, my husband Andy, and my fellow Rhode Islanders:

We gather this evening for an annual address that is as much about honoring a tradition of cooperation between the legislature and the governor as it is about setting priorities and crafting a state budget.

We're at a time in America when the angriest among us often have the loudest voices, and politicians seem like they're always shouting past each other.

Here in Rhode Island, though, we are showing that we can forge consensus, and achieve progress through collaboration and compromise.

To the members of this Assembly, thank you for your partnership, and commitment to Rhode Island -- because of it we are having a real impact on our neighbors.

Most Sundays, my family and I go grocery shopping after Mass. We were recently at Stop & Shop on Branch Avenue, when a young man -- maybe 35 -- came up to talk to me. That's not unusual -- I often do more talking than shopping.

He looked like he'd just come from Church, too, and he told me about what a tough time he was having. He didn't mind working hard -- in fact he wanted to work hard. But he said he just couldn't get enough hours to stay ahead of his bills.

I think about him -- and countless others just like him -- every day. When I wake up in the morning, and when I put my kids to bed at night, my mind is on getting people back to work, growing our economy, and ensuring that everyone can ""make it in Rhode Island.""

I know that many Rhode Islanders are frustrated.

We're frustrated because government doesn't work as well as it should

 because there are too many potholes and crumbling bridges
                              
 and too many of our friends can't find work, or are struggling with wages that aren't increasing as fast as their bills.

But the good news is that we are making progress and our state is getting stronger by the day.

Last year: 
*           our housing market had the strongest year since 2004;

*           our economy created more than 8,000 jobs, the most jobs we've created in a single year since 2000;

*           and our unemployment rate dropped more than any other state in the nation.

Let me say that again: Rhode Island had a larger drop in its unemployment rate last year than any other state in the nation -- to 5.1 percent.

We might be a small state, but that's a big deal.

Another story of our progress lies just a few blocks from here. A couple of weeks ago we signed a contract to move forward with a major life sciences complex on the 195 land.

I've worked hard on thismeeting with executives to persuade them that Rhode Island was the place to invest. As you know, I'll go anywhere, or meet with anyone, to put people to work in Rhode Island.

It's not a done deal yet, but we are closer than ever to realizing our vision of establishing a magnet of innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment on the 195 land. This project has the potential to create hundreds of good jobs for Rhode Island families and be a foundation upon which we build a stronger economy.

A big part of the reason this is happening is because of the economic development tools the General Assembly passed last year.

That's the kind of partnership that works for all of Rhode Island.

We're hard at work utilizing those tools to create jobs for Rhode Islanders.

Greystone is a local manufacturer. The company has been manufacturing components for the automotive and aerospace industries since 1932.

It also has a facility in Virginia, and was considering an expansion there instead of here.

We've heard this story before haven't we? A local business choosing to grow . . . only somewhere else.

But this time the story has a different ending.

Because of the job-creating tools this legislature passed last year, we were able to convince Greystone to expand in Rhode Island, instead of in Virginia. We offered targeted tax benefits, and now 25 good-paying, advanced manufacturing jobs are being created in Rhode Island.

That means 25 more Rhode Islanders will proudly be able to go off to work in the morning, and come home at night feeling a little more secure.

On the one hand, this is just 25 jobs, and Greystone is just one company. But it shows early results that the economic development tools are working.

In the last month, our tools have helped 3 major real estate projects advance, and we've awarded 11 innovation vouchers to support partnerships between businesses and universities.

Whether it's transformative projects like Wexford -- or smaller wins like Greystone -- together, we will rebuild this economy one good job at a time.

And, while we're at it, let's reject the politics of procrastination and pass RhodeWorks. Rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges is essential to attracting great companies, and we'll put thousands of Rhode Islanders to work in the process.

Thank you Speaker and Senate President for moving this forward.

We've also made progress in helping hard working Rhode Islanders put a little more money in their pockets. And working together again, we can do even more:

We expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit last year so families could keep more of what they earn. I propose we expand it once again and help more than 85,000 taxpayers keep a little more of their hard earned income.
 

We increased the minimum wage last year, giving 40,000 Rhode Islanders a raise. Tonight, I'm asking you to raise it a little more to $10.10. No one who works full time should have to raise their family in poverty.
And thanks to Speaker Mattiello's leadership -- we reduced the taxes seniors pay on their social security benefits. My mom's here tonight -- she especially likes this one.
 

I'm excited about the progress we've made in just one year.

But we must keep going.

The global economy is changing faster than ever before. Our job is to ensure that Rhode Islanders aren't left behind.

To position our state for success by building a stronger economy that produces jobs that pay.

To do this, our economy has to be based on advanced industries. Industries that are driven by technology and research and development, and that employ people with technical skills.

Nationally, advanced industries are expanding much faster than the economy as a whole.

And these industries are marked by high wage jobs at all levels. In 2013, the average advanced industry employee earned $90,000. Many of these jobs don't require a 4-year college degree, but they do require advanced skills. Skills that are within the grasp of anyone willing to reach for them.

It's pretty simple: advanced industry jobs create high wages and economic growth.

Now, the good news, is that we have great strengths in many advanced industries, such as defense, IT services, and biomedical innovation. The bad news is that over the past 30 years, employment in these industries fell at a faster rate in Rhode Island than in any other state in the nation.

It's no surprise then that -- in the last decade -- our average family income actually went down.

It's clear: if we want to grow high wage jobs in Rhode Island, we need to skate to where the puck will be.

We need our people to have skills that matter, and jobs that pay.

To create these high-paying jobs in Rhode Island, first we need to encourage our businesses to invest even more in research and development and to partner with our great colleges and universities. Every day businesses are investing new, cool products -- I want them doing that here in Rhode Island

So, tonight, I propose a major expansion of our Research & Development tax credit, which will encourage people to develop and to make new, cutting edge products in Rhode Island.

R&D boosts economic growth. Leading experts believe that the R&D credit is one of the strongest tools to drive the creation of more American jobs. Jobs we need in Rhode Island.

I am also proposing a statewide competition funded by a bond initiative to build an innovation campus in Rhode Island.

We will ask universities like URI to partner with businesses to create a place where researchers can work alongside business people to turn their inventions into new products, services, businesses, and -- most importantly -- jobs.

A great model is the International Center for Automotive Research in South Carolina. There, the State funded a partnership between BMW and Clemson University that has helped create thousands of jobs in the region -- good-paying jobs at every level, from entry-level technicians to higher-paid managers. Over a dozen companies moved to access the talent and technology produced there.

If South Carolina can do this, so can we.  Our families deserve these high wage jobs. Let's work together to make this happen for Rhode Island. 

Another way to attract new businesses is to stop the brain drain, and keep more of our talented kids here.

Last year -- working with Rep. Blazejewski and Sen. Pearson -- we created the Wavemaker fellowship to help repay student loans for college graduates who stay in Rhode Island.

Tonight, I propose we expand that program so that anyone who graduates from a Rhode Island university -- with a B+ average in a science or technology field -- and who stays in Rhode Island in a STEAM job -- will get help paying back their student loans. 

These are just some of the things we can do together to build an environment where 21st century businesses want to be. Where people have skills that matter and jobs that pay.

Recently Electric Boat announced that they will add thousands of new jobs in Rhode Island in the years ahead. But the company also expressed concern about finding enough trained workers here to fill those positions.

It just confirms what we already know: modern businesses value access to skilled talent above almost anything else.

Soon, 70 percent of jobs in Rhode Island will require some form of post-secondary education. But, only 40 percent of Rhode Islanders have a post-secondary degree or credential. That has to change.

Creating a pipeline of educated and skilled workers is one of the most important things we can do over the long-term to attract businesses to Rhode Island.

Working together over the last year we've made huge progress.

We made college more affordable for more families.

We launched PrepareRI and made it possible for high school students to take college classes for free. It's helping students like Katherine Carrillo, a senior at Central Falls High School.

Katherine works part-time to help her family, plays soccer, and is taking four college courses. When she goes to college, these credits will transfer, making it easier for her to afford college, and to graduate on time.

We also created the Rhode Island Promise Scholarship Fund, which has made it possible for 6,000 students to attend college in Rhode Island.

That's six thousand lives changed forever.

One of those students is Genesis Sanchez Tavarez, a junior at Rhode Island College, here with us tonight. She was working three jobs while also going to school. She got a Rhode Island Promise scholarship, now she only works one job, and can focus more on school. We're proud of you Genesis! Keep going.

The budget I present tonight continues funding for this scholarship program, and it also ensures that we won't have to raise tuition at URI, RIC, or CCRI.

We're rebuilding our economy, and trying to get more people to go to college. This would be the worst time to jack up the price tag.

But it's not just our colleges and universities -- we have to promote lifelong learning, and that means continuing to emphasize workforce development.

With our ""Real Jobs Rhode Island"" initiative, we've made major programs on job training. We've put employers in the driver's seat -- and are letting them design the training -- so that we prepare people for jobs that are available now.

In the last year alone, we've already engaged nearly 200 employers who are working with us to train 1,000 Rhode Islanders. 
And we're just getting started.

Now, if we are going to have the best pipeline of skilled workers in America, we have to do much more to improve our public schools.
Thanks to Senate President Paiva Weed's leadership, last year we expanded the number of pre-k classrooms and made all-day kindergarten universal across Rhode Island.

This year, we are adding a proposal to make the SAT free for all students -- and one to expand computer science programs in all grades-- all with the goal of making our kids' college or career ready.

But there's much more to do.

Only about a third of our students are meeting expectations in English, and even fewer in math.

Rhode Island has the lowest high school graduation rate in New England.

And, sadly, Rhode Island has one of the largest ""achievement gaps"" between whites and non-whites in the entire nation.

All of our kids deserve better, and I know -- acting together -- that we can improve our schools so children can get the skills they need to succeed in today's economy.

To begin with, our kids can't learn in crumbling school buildings. Last year, we launched a new School Building Authority to modernize our school buildings, and work has started.

Tonight, I'm proposing that we invest another $50 million to rebuild schools across our state.

Next, we need to ensure that we are fair in the way we fund our public schools.

A diverse group of Rhode Islanders recently completed a review of our education funding formula. Thank you to Representatives Amore and Ruggiero -- and Senators DaPonte and Gallo -- for serving on the working group.

Tonight I propose a revised funding formula that maintains the importance of ""money following the child.""

But it also levels the playing field between district and charter schools so that all schools can thrive. It provides that when a student moves from a district school to a charter school, some of the money stays behind at the district school.

As a result, our public schools will see new investments, and every school district in Rhode Island will be better off than it was before these changes.

The proposal also recognizes that certain students face specific challenges which impose extra costs on the schools that educate them.

Our proposal boosts resources for schools with students who have greater needs. But we're only going to pay for what works. So if schools want the extra money, they have to adopt proven best practices.

Finally, parents and taxpayers deserve to know how school dollars are spent. So the budget I submit tonight requires every public school to make its actual budget available online for everyone to see. Districts are already collecting the data; let's post it so everyone can see how our dollars are being invested.

Our Education Commissioner will soon present a plan to you that's designed to strengthen our public schools.  It's a plan rooted in the core belief that all public schools should be high quality schools. And that every kid deserves a public school that will prepare them for their future.

To succeed these days, our students need much more than just math and reading skills. They also need to learn how to collaborate, solve problems, and be digitally literate, particularly in computer science.

Rhode Island already ranks seventh in the country in spending, so resources alone aren't the answer.

The plan that the Commissioner will detail in the weeks ahead relies heavily on what's worked in Massachusetts.

Massachusetts and Rhode Island schools performed at relatively similar levels about 20 years ago. Since then, Massachusetts has rocketed ahead, and built some of the best public schools in the country. Not surprisingly, its economy has thrived.

It's time for us to follow a similar path.

That means keeping our standards high and consistent across the state.

But it also means empowering school leaders by giving principals and teachers more flexibility to meet the needs of their individual students. 

We need to give educators the autonomy and support they need to do their jobs; and then we need to demand evidence that they're meeting statewide standards.

And, like Massachusetts, let's offer parents and families more choices within the public school system -- so that they can send their child to the public school that is right for them.

Adhering to these core principles -- high standards, accountability, school empowerment, and expanded choice -- Massachusetts saw test scores rise, students succeed, and their economy boom.

We can do this, and we should.

Jobs that pay, and skills that matter: these are the building blocks of a stronger economy. But we need a solid foundation -- a business climate that makes it easier to do business in Rhode Island, and a government that is fiscally responsible.

Last year, we achieved meaningful savings in Medicaid, and created certainty by locking in pension savings. Together these initiatives have allowed us to avoid tax increases, invest in education and economic development, and reduce our structural deficit.

We also eliminated the business tax on energy, cut taxes on small businesses, and maintained the lowest corporate tax in New England.

We have to keep going.

The budget I submit tonight contains a ""Making it Easier to Do Business"" proposal. First, it expands online permitting so it'll be easier for businesses to operate. Second, it targets waste and fraud, especially in our TDI system. And third it lowers the unemployment insurance taxes that businesses pay.

Rhode Island ranks our state 49th in the nation -- in unemployment insurance taxes.

We have to attack areas like this where we're an outlier. Our plan will reduce UI taxes, without harming benefits.

This tax cut will save Rhode Island businesses $30 million next year alone. And it's the first time Rhode Island has moved off of the highest tax bracket since 1992.

Let's work together to get this done, and let businesses thrive in Rhode Island.
I've spent a lot of time talking about the economy tonight because putting people back to work is our top priority. But it's not our only priority. There are other critical issues addressed in this budget, such as preparing Rhode Island for the challenges of climate change -- a threat that we, as the Ocean State, are uniquely vulnerable to. And we must meet these challenges too. 

But tonight I'd like to touch on just one more issue: the public health crisis of overdose deaths in Rhode Island. Over 200 Rhode Islanders died from opioid-related overdoses in 2014. Since 2005, the number of drug poisoning deaths has exceeded the number of deaths from car crashes and firearms combined.

Elise from Pawtucket and her husband are here in the chamber with us tonight. They had two adult sons: Teddy, age 30 and Paul, age 22. Both started using prescription painkillers to deal with back pain from their jobs as furniture movers. We lost both of them to drug overdoses.

As parents, Andy and I can't imagine your pain. Elise is courageously telling their story, and fighting to reassure other families that they aren't alone.

Let's commit tonight to joining their fight.

I am committed, as I know you are, to addressing this crisis. Let's set a goal of driving down overdose deaths by one-third within three years. We can, if we focus on four areas: (1) treatment, (2) overdose reversals, (3) prevention, and (4) recovery.

Among other things, the budget I submit tonight calls for investing more in treatment. The experts say that this is one of the most powerful things we can do to reduce overdose deaths, so I'm inviting you to work with me to get it done.

I've said it many times before: my vision is of a state where everyone can ""make it in Rhode Island.""

Together, we can make Rhode Island a place where Genesis doesn't need to work three jobs to afford college

a place where my friend from Stop & Shop can to go sleep each night knowing he earned a decent wage and is ahead on his bills

a place where every Rhode Islander willing to work hard -- has a chance to achieve their dreams.

and a place where parents like Elise and our friend, former Senator Rhoda Perry don't have to bury their children because of an overdose.

Last year I said that we have a tall hill to climb to turn this economy around. And, yes it is still steep. I sure can't climb it alone.

To all of you who've rolled up your sleeves to help -- volunteers, state employees and members of this Assembly, I say thank you.

We won't always agree, but we are bound together by a love for Rhode Island, and a commitment to lift up our state.

So, together, let's march to the top of the hill and make Rhode Island a place of opportunity for all of our families. 

Thank you.",TRUE,Executive Address,02/11/16 04:44 PM
47879,1038083,State of the State Address,01/20/16,1,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the General Assembly, constitutional officers and my fellow South Carolinians:

Each year we come together to discuss the state of our state, and each year we begin by acknowledging those who lost their lives in the service of our state and of our nation.

By the grace of God, this will be the first year I do not list a single active duty member of our armed forces who was taken from us. That is a blessing.

But the men and women of our military are not alone in their willingness to sacrifice for us and in their dedication to keeping us safe.

So now, please join me as we pay tribute to those who gave the last full measure of devotion in the service of South Carolina and her people:

Officer Gregory Thomas Alia, Columbia;

Officer Stacy Lynn Case, Columbia;

Deputy Sheriff Delton Daniels, Bennettsville;

Firefighter Stuart Gregory Hardy, Beaufort;

Firefighter Kenneth Michael Stanton, Sr., Pendleton;

Firefighter Tyron Weston, Columbia.

On behalf of all South Carolinians, to their families, know we will never forget.

I have always felt blessed to have the support of my family. Michael has always been my most trusted advisor. This year, that was even more true. He supported me through the grief, the decisions we made, and the prayers as we moved forward through South Carolina's tragedies. A public servant is only as strong as the strength she has at home. Please help me welcome my strength, my partner, and the coolest First Man ever, Michael Haley.

It is hard to believe how much my little ones have grown. They have spent so much of their lives in the public eye, and these two handle it in a way that makes us so proud. This is Rena's last year at home before she ventures off to college, which breaks my heart, and Nalin is finishing his last year in middle school. Please help me welcome my pride and joy, Rena and Nalin.

Recently, we lost a senator whose warmth and graciousness touched so many here at the Statehouse and across his district. Billy O'Dell was a loving husband, father, and grandfather. For more than 25 years, his work for the people of his district made South Carolina a better place, and along with his wife, Gayle, his son and daughter-in-law, Chip and Angela, and his daughter, Michelle, we mourn his passing. Mrs. O'Dell, your husband was loved by those within this chamber and by so many more outside of it. Thank you and your family for being here and for your service to our state.

This has been a different kind of year for South Carolina, a year that warrants a different kind of speech. While there is plenty to celebrate in our state, it would be neither honest nor productive to ignore the great challenges that were thrust upon South Carolina in 2015.

Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our state is bent but not broken.

As I look around this distinguished chamber tonight, there is a hole. It is a hole felt far beyond this Statehouse, a hole that tore deeply through the very soul of South Carolina.

Senator Clementa Pinckney served the people of South Carolina, in this very building, for eighteen years. He should be sitting with us tonight. Sadly, he is not.

This is an infinitely dimmer room because of it.

But his legacy lives on. It lives on in his works. It lives on in his church. It lives on in his friends. It will soon live on in the portrait that his colleagues will raise in the Senate Chamber, just across the hall. But most of all, it lives on in his family, in his wife, Jennifer, and their two beautiful daughters, Eliana and Malana.

They are here tonight.

Please join me, and all of South Carolina, in paying our deep respect to the Pinckney family.

Thank you for taking the time to be with us. This is an infinitely brighter room because you are here.

In the days following the tragedy at Mother Emanuel, and in the many months since, I have thought a great deal about Senator Pinckney.

I did not know him well, but what I knew was that in every interaction we had, he was always kind and respectful.

I knew him to be a goodhearted public official. I knew him to be a senator who spoke infrequently, but when he did, it was with great intensity and even greater authority. I knew him to be a man who never seemed to speak against anyone or anything but, instead, to advocate for the people and the ideas that he believed in.

The building we sit in invites disagreement. That is a good thing, a healthy thing - we should not pretend to all believe the same things nor should we be silent about where and when we differ.

But disagreement does not have to mean division. Honest policy differences do not need to morph into personal dislike, distrust, and disillusion. After all, to paraphrase something I read last June, we are more than just members of warring political tribes but brothers and sisters and fellow South Carolinians.

Senator Pinckney was more than just a senator; he was a father, a husband, a brother, a son, a reverend.

We should all spend a little more time getting to know the people behind the policies.

Before the tragedy of Mother Emanuel in June, there was the tragedy of Walter Scott in April.

We all recall what happened in that case: Mr. Scott was stopped by a North Charleston police officer for having a broken taillight. What ensued was caught on video for the entire world to see: Mr. Scott began to run from the officer, who shot him repeatedly in the back, tragically ending his life.

We were betrayed by one of our own.

The vast, vast majority of police officers in this nation are honorable men and women. They keep us safe.

But, unfortunately, what happened in North Charleston on April 4th was not a unique event in America today.

What happened after was.

In the face of overwhelming video evidence that something had gone terribly wrong, South Carolina did not erupt in riots or violence.

Instead, we focused on justice and progress.

Justice for Walter Scott and his family. Progress for our state.

That focus meant everything to South Carolina. And it began with the Scott family.

They started the calming of our community. Their words and actions allowed South Carolina the chance to right this wrong, the best we could, without the influence of outsiders.

Their response drove ours. And just two months after Mr. Scott was senselessly killed, I stood with his family and signed into law the first body camera bill in America.

I was proud to stand with the Scott family that day. I am proud to recognize Mr. Walter Scott, Sr., his wife, Judy, and their son and daughter-in-law, Rodney and Jenarious, who are here with us tonight

Thank you for your graciousness in a time of unimaginable sorrow. South Carolina will forever grieve the loss of your son and be forever grateful to you and your family for helping us learn from your tragedy, grow from it, and take action to make sure, to the best of our ability, it never happens again.

South Carolina was devastated by man-made tragedies in 2015.

As if that wasn't enough, last year also saw the biggest natural disaster our state had endured since Hurricane Hugo.

Starting my first year in office, we have conducted emergency tabletop exercises that allow us to go through disaster situations in real time. Each year we work to improve our planning and our preparation. The disaster we always thought we were preparing for was a hurricane. Thankfully, that hurricane has not come this way.

What did, in 2014, were two winter storms that challenged our infrastructure, our utility companies, and our resources. South Carolina shined through those storms.

But this year was something neither we, nor the weathermen, could ever have imagined. Rain at unbelievable levels, pouring from the sky for hours. Enough rain, according to one report, to give each American one bottle of water every day for the next 182 years.

October's 1,000-Year flood was one that challenged our state in a way few natural disasters ever have.

I cannot give enough credit to General Bob Livingston, Director of Emergency Management Kim Stenson, Secretary of Transportation Christy Hall, and the other leaders of our agencies who understood that can't is not an option.

This team knew they couldn't sleep until we made sure we had done everything in our power to keep people safe, provide aid to those in need, and strengthen our citizens with the information and the resources to move forward.

Please help me thank a group of people who didn't back down from a historic challenge, one I am proud to call Team South Carolina.

With good reason, we talk a lot about the things South Carolina does well, the records we are breaking, the rankings that show us rising to the top.

Number one in foreign investment. The number one exporter of tires. One of the fastest growing economies on the east coast. The friendliest state in the country. The most patriotic.

All of South Carolina should take pride in those facts.

There are others, however, we talk about less. And that we should never be proud of.

There is no excuse for South Carolina to rank as the state in America with the highest percentage of women killed by men.

Domestic violence is an issue that has plagued us for far too long. Tonight, I say it will plague us to that extent no more.

Last year, the General Assembly passed a very real, very important bill to help rid South Carolina of the poison of domestic violence. Thank you for all the work that went into sending that bill to my desk.

But we also know that our domestic violence epidemic is not going to be fixed by legislation alone. In order to truly solve this problem, it will take a complete culture change.

So a year ago, we established a domestic violence task force, made up of 135 members representing 65 organizations across South Carolina. We committed to educating ourselves and each other about every aspect that a survivor goes through and all the contact points touched when a situation occurs, contact points that could be opportunities to save a life. We looked at not just the root causes but also how these cases were being handled, county by county, throughout our state.

We learned a lot. And we're taking action.

First, victims are not victims - they are survivors. We know that domestic violence is a choice the abuser makes, not the survivor. We need a culture of empowerment, rather than one of re-victimization.

Second, those survivors need to know that we have their backs - they need lawyers, not law enforcement officers, prosecuting domestic violence crimes. We need officers to be officers out in the field, and we need prosecutors to be prosecutors in the courtroom. South Carolina is one of only three states that allow law enforcement officers to try domestic violence crimes. That ends this year.

My Executive Budget includes additional prosecutors to fix this problem. No survivor deserves to show up in court and see a legally untrained police officer arguing his or her side, while a highly-paid defense lawyer argues on behalf of the abuser. If you join me, in South Carolina, no survivor ever will again.

There is more that we have done and still more to do. That's why I have extended the task force. But after the action we have taken together this past year, survivors of domestic violence across South Carolina can take comfort knowing that their government and the people of our state see them, hear them, and that they are no longer alone.

You've heard me say it before - growing up in Bamberg, we didn't know what we didn't have.

For me, that's not the case anymore - I know exactly what we didn't have. And after visiting hundreds of schools across our state, I know exactly what many of today's kids don't have.

I have seen the disparities, and I won't stand by and allow them to continue.

We want to raise our children to know they are worthy of a good education. We want to raise our children with the confidence and the resources so they believe the sky is the limit.

Our focus for the last three years has been to right some wrongs. All of us did that together.

Thanks to your support, we changed the funding formula so that no one can ever say again that we educate children based solely on where they are born and raised.

Thanks to your support, we have put reading coaches in every elementary school and will no longer pass a child out of the third grade if they can't read.

Thanks to your support, wealthy districts are not the only ones investing in technology anymore - meaning wealthy districts are not the only ones that teach their students for the future, not the past.

And thanks to your support, we did it all without raising taxes.

But we're not done.

First, we need to let the voters of South Carolina decide if they want the Governor to appoint the Superintendent of Education. Education must be a priority for every governor - and to be successful, every governor must have a partner in the Education Department.

Superintendent Spearman has been a great partner since her election. But the history of South Carolina shows that has not always been the case, and our children have suffered as a result.

This is a change that will not take place until after I'm long gone from the Governor's Office, so it is not for my benefit that I ask you to support this initiative. It's for our children. And for theirs.

Second, in South Carolina we have high turnover of teachers in rural and challenged school districts. That affects a child, as they don't have consistency in their teachers. And it affects teachers, who are either constantly adapting to new environments or constantly watching their colleagues leave.

So this will be the first year we aggressively start recruiting teachers to rural districts and, just as aggressively, incentivizing them to stay there.

If a student agrees to teach in a challenged district for eight years, we will cover the full cost of their education at a state university. For recent graduates who agree to the same commitment, we will repay their student loans. For career educators who want to grow professionally and teach in these challenged districts, we will cover the cost of their graduate coursework. And we will support mentorship programs for all of the above.

Children deserve to know that teachers believe in them enough to stay. We have to slow this revolving door. I know we can, and now, I know we will.

Finally, we cannot continue to ignore that in much of our state, we have a facilities problem.

Children can't learn as well when the walls of their classrooms are crumbling around them. Teachers can't teach as well when the hallways they walk are littered with puddles. Our students and our teachers deserve no less than to go to school each day in a place that is safe and clean.

Over the last year, there has been much discussion about floating a bond bill.

I am not unilaterally opposed to using South Carolina's bonding capacity to serve the most critical needs of our state. There are times it makes sense. It is why I signed a bill in 2012 to use that capacity to invest $1 billion in our roads. It is why I have supported using that capacity for extraordinary economic development projects.

It is also why I opposed last year, and will oppose this year, any effort to bond out hundreds of millions of dollars to fill a wish list for our already bloated higher education system. No one can look at the tuition hikes parents and students have seen over the last decade and tell me that higher education doesn't have enough money. And no one can drive the campuses of Clemson, South Carolina, and so many others, see the brand new facilities and massive new construction projects, and tell me that they represent our greatest need.

That is not true of elementary, middle, and high schools in Denmark. Or Clarendon. Or Abbeville.

So here is what I propose: Let's pass legislation permanently dedicating up to one percent of our state's bond capacity to K-12 education facilities.

Now, I do not propose that all school districts in South Carolina are eligible for state support. Nor do I propose that the school districts themselves determine whether or not they qualify. This must be a thorough, priority-based process by which those districts that truly need our help get it, and those that don't, don't.

It starts with a complete evaluation of the facilities in which our children are currently attending school.

It includes the development of a strict set of building standards so that school districts will be able to build age and size-appropriate schools but not break the bank or waste millions of dollars on architects and blueprints, dollars that would be far better spent if that money actually touched a child and a teacher.

And finally, it includes restrictions on local governments - we are not helping school districts construct a school so that they can turn around and raise taxes on their people to build another one, or worse, a more extravagant one.

We have the opportunity to help those children in South Carolina who need it most. We have the opportunity to give dedicated teachers a safe place that allows them to do what they've always wanted: Impact the lives of their students. We have the opportunity to do it responsibly and without raising taxes.

We can waste that opportunity, if we so choose, on high-rise dorms, sparkling new graduate centers, and world-class administrative buildings. But if we don't focus on K-12, and focus on it now, higher education won't even be a possibility for far too many South Carolina children.

Last year, I told you I didn't know what else to say about ethics reform, that we'd talked about it for years and that we weren't asking that much, just for some simple, common sense, good government changes. Yet here we are again.

Our two main priorities haven't changed: Requiring public officials to disclose who pays them and having independent investigators oversee legislators, just like they do for every other elected official in the state.

The House has passed both. Repeatedly. South Carolina thanks you for that.

The Senate has refused to even vote on either. Repeatedly.

It should not be this hard. We should not still be having this conversation four years in. We owe our people better. We owe them an up or down vote. Give it to them this year. And then we can celebrate.

As you may have noticed, I love to celebrate. We build things in South Carolina. We build planes with Boeing. We have five international tire companies. We are the BMW capital of the world. We broke ground yesterday on a billion dollar investment by the largest producer of carbon fiber in the world, Toray Industries.

This past year our South Carolina family continued to grow, and we will soon be building more automobiles than ever before.

Mercedes-Benz Vans will soon be manufacturing Sprinter and Metris vans in South Carolina. Their custom automobiles are designed for commercial and freight transport and for executive purposes, with swivel chairs, cup warmers, coolers, and more options than you can imagine. They truly are the coolest vans you'll ever see, and we want every company across South Carolina and the world to buy these American-made vans.

Daimler also has Freightliner Custom Chassis operations in Cherokee County, and today, they announced an expansion there with a $22 million investment.

Please help me welcome Michael Balke and Roger Nielsen as we give our total support to Mercedes-Benz Vans and Daimler.

In May, I sat with Secretary Bobby Hitt and our teams in the Governor's Mansion library with Carroll Campbell's portrait looking over us. We took a long-awaited call that Volvo Cars had chosen to partner with South Carolina as they begin their journey of manufacturing in America.

Volvo is known for its reputation of quality and safety. We are so proud that they trust South Carolina to help them continue to deliver to their customers. To our friends at Volvo, I have total faith in our workforce. We won't let you down. Please help me welcome Katarina Fjording and Katherine Yehl of Volvo Cars.

And there is more to celebrate over the last year than those two major additions to the South Carolina family.

South Carolina's unemployment rate sits at 5.5 percent, the lowest since 2001.

In the last two years, we've saved businesses more than $151 million in unemployment taxes.

We have cut our debt service by almost half over the last five years, while at the same time doubling our General Reserves.

We've moved almost 30,000 people from welfare-to-work.

The most recent data shows the rate of released inmates returning to prison has decreased by more than 25 percent.

2015 was the third year in a row with record-breaking tourism.

And there are more people working today than ever before in the history of South Carolina.

These things don't happen by accident. World-class manufacturers don't make multi-billion dollar decisions to call South Carolina home on a whim, and our historic employment levels are not the result of a great string of luck.

We have worked for our successes. We have been smart; we have paid attention to the changing world around us and to the growing competition for good jobs that pay good wages. We have kept our fiscal house in order and protected our credit rating. We have invested in our ports, in our workforce, and in our children's futures.

It is a great day in South Carolina. But as I learned a long, long time ago, good times don't last if we squander them. So let's continue to be smart, to work together, so that we grow our success and not sit back, complacent, and watch it drift away.

To that end, transportation has been a topic of great interest and even greater discussion of late, so I will be brief, and also, I hope, clear: I think no differently of our roads situation than when I stood before you one year ago.

I will not sign any piece of legislation that raises taxes - not in year one, not in year five, not in year ten. I will not sign any piece of legislation that does not include real reform to the Department of Transportation - the days of horse-trading South Carolina roads have to end. And I will not buy into the idea that we somehow cannot afford to cut income taxes for our people.

In December, a University of South Carolina economist said, ""In 28 years of forecasting our state's economy, rarely have I seen (it) in such good shape and on such steady footing."" We had $1 billion in new revenue last year. We have $1.3 billion in new revenue this year. My Executive Budget includes every dollar needed to pay for this year's tax cut. Next year's will too.

This is not our money. It belongs to the taxpayers. We can and we should return it to them.

Pass legislation that cuts our taxes, reforms our flawed transportation system, and invests in our roads, and I will sign it.

Pass legislation that does not do all three of those things, and I will veto it.

The choice is clear, and it's all yours.

I cannot end a speech about where the state of South Carolina stands in January of 2016 without first talking about the most impactful experience of this past year: The Mother Emanuel tragedy.

Sharonda Coleman-Singleton;

Depayne Middleton Doctor;

Cynthia Hurd;

Susie Jackson;

Ethel Lance;

Clementa Pinckney;

Tywanza Sanders;

Daniel Simmons;

Myra Thompson.

The nine we lost in the most sacred of places. Their memories will forever be with us. My family and I pray for them and for theirs. Every day.

When I speak of the tragedy, I no longer speak of the ""Emanuel Nine."" I speak of the ""Emanuel 12.""

Why?

On June 17th, there were twelve men and women who went into that Bible study.

I have said it before, but I imagine I will say it until I no longer have the capacity to speak at all: Those twelve people did what so many South Carolinians do on a normal Wednesday night. They went to Bible study, to profess and to grow their faith.

But that was not a normal Wednesday night. That night someone else joined them. He didn't look like them, didn't sound like them, and didn't act like them. They didn't call the police. They didn't throw him out. Instead they pulled up a chair and prayed with him. For an hour.

For reasons only God knows, we lost nine amazing souls that night.

So too, for reasons only He knows, God decided He wasn't ready to take three more, that He still had work for them to do.

I ask that you join my family as we pray for Mrs. Felicia Sanders, for her eleven year-old granddaughter, and for Mrs. Polly Sheppard, as they continue to live with that memory.

Mrs. Sanders and Mrs. Sheppard are here, joining us in the chamber tonight.

I am so grateful that they are.

Just as the nine we lost inform my belief that angels must exist in Heaven, these two women, and the precious little one who was with them that night, are proof that we have angels living here on Earth.

Please join me in expressing to Mrs. Sanders and Mrs. Sheppard the warmth, gratitude, and above all the love that the entire State of South Carolina feels toward them.

Ethel Lance, who despite losing her daughter to cancer, was a woman of love and joy, known for constantly singing her favorite song. ""One day at a time, Sweet Jesus, that's all I'm asking of you,"" she would sing. ""Just give me the strength to do every day what I have to do.""

Just give me the strength to do every day what I have to do.

We are a different South Carolina than we were one year ago. Of that there can be no doubt. A place, a people, cannot go through what we have gone through and not come out changed on the other side.

The questions we in this room must ask ourselves are: What does that mean? What do we do with it?

My hope is that we follow the example set by those around us.

Those twelve who prayed with a stranger

Their families who forgave a murderer.

That community that came together.

Our state that inspired a nation.

There is greatness in South Carolina, a greatness embodied by our people, a greatness unequaled in our country.

We have all seen it. We all know it.

It is my fervent wish that, in this year, we, as the representatives of those people, act in a manner that is worthy of that greatness.

For if we do, there is no limit to where we can take our state.

So I will continue to work toward a brighter future.

I will continue to believe in a stronger South Carolina.

And I will continue to pray that God gives me - and you - the strength to do every day what we have to do.

Thank you, God bless you, and may He continue to bless the great State of South Carolina.",TRUE,Executive Address,02/12/16 08:49 AM
11218,1038107,State of the State,01/12/16,1,"Thank you.  It's good to have you back in Pierre.  Before I begin today, we have three new legislators who have joined us since last year.  I'd ask Sen. Bill Shorma of Dakota Dunes, Sen. Scott Fiegen of Dell Rapids, and Rep. Wayne Steinhauer of Hartford to stand so we can welcome them.

I'd like to begin today by talking about education funding.  A year ago, I created the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Teachers and Students to look into the important issues of education funding and teacher pay.  This task force included educators, legislators, members of my administration, and members of the public.

The task force undertook an extensive process of seeking public input.  Task force members organized or attended dozens of meetings and sought feedback from thousands of South Dakotans.  They heard an overwhelming message:  the public believes we need to be bold and act to address teacher salaries, this year.

Following that public input, the task force held five day-long, public meetings to consider data, discuss policy options, and ultimately to make recommendations.  I want to thank the task force members for their very thorough work.  The final report makes thoughtful recommendations & is an excellent overview of this topic.

The key to student achievement is an effective teacher.  We all know that.  It is the #1 factor that we can control.  Despite that, we all know that SD's teacher salaries are lowest in the nation and have been for decades.

This problem has come to the forefront now because, more and more, we are hearing from school administrators that the teaching workforce is getting smaller.  Schools are getting fewer applicants for each position.  Some teaching disciplines, like math and science, are even more limited.  And in remote geographic areas, some schools struggle to attract any applicants at all.

The data supports this anecdotal evidence.  The task force report includes projections from the Dept. of Ed. which show that over the next five years, SD will have only one new teacher for each position that comes open.

One teacher per opening may not sound like a shortage, but for most districts it is.  The new teachers coming into the profession will not align with the disciplines where there are openings.  There won't be enough new teachers in hard-to-fill disciplines.  Rural or remote districts will still struggle to hire.  And the quality of education suffers when schools cannot be selective and have to hire from a very constricted pool of applicants.  That's why the task force found that ""the incoming pipeline of teachers will not meet the projected needs of districts"" over the next five years.

We need to increase the supply of new teachers entering the field, and we need more current teachers to stay in the field.  Now, I know that other areas of the workforce are seeing similar trends.  These shortages are caused by many demographic and economic factors.  Salaries are not the only cause of this problem.  But we cannot fix this problem unless we increase salaries.

We all know that, although SD is last in teacher salaries, we are not last in spending per student.  Depending on the source, we usually rank around 40th.  The task force considered several possible explanations for this.  For example, some were surprised to learn that our spending on administrators, both in terms of salaries and number of administrators, is comparable to national averages and lower than some other states in our region.

Ultimately, the task force found that SD's spending per student is due to the rural nature of our state.  We actually spend more, per student, on facilities and maintenance than the national average.  We also have more teachers per student than the national average.

Significantly though, we spend less per student than all of our surrounding states.  The states that are most like us --North Dakota, Montana, and Nebraska -- spend more per student than we do, have more teachers per student than we do, and pay higher salaries than we do.

The bad news is:  that gap is getting worse.  We compete with our surrounding states for teachers, and we are falling further behind them.  Ten years ago, SD's average teacher salary was about $2000 behind North Dakota.  We were 51st and they were 49th.  Montana was 47th and Nebraska was 42nd.

Today, we are still closest to North Dakota among our surrounding states.  But the gap is not $2000.  It is $8000.  We still rank 51st.  North Dakota moved from 49th to 36th.  Montana moved from 47th to 28th.  Nebraska moved from 42nd to 32nd.

And even when you adjust for cost of living, SD falls behind our surrounding states.  We are closest to North Dakota, but nearly $6000 behind.  After adjusting for cost of living, SD is nearly $10,000 behind Minnesota.

If SD wants to maintain high student achievement, we need a new generation of high quality teachers.  We are not going to get them unless we become more competitive with surrounding states.  And when you delve into the numbers, you reach the conclusion that the only way to become more competitive is to increase our state's average teacher salary.  We need to add more money into the system.  Much like other problems we have confronted together, SD faces a deteriorating situation if we don't take action.

To address this need, I am proposing a one half cent increase in the state sales tax.  This plan will bring about competitive teacher pay, a transparent and fair funding formula, and a more efficient education system.  This plan is based upon the Blue Ribbon report and will achieve its goals.

The one half cent will generate $40 million in new revenue beyond our needs, however.  I propose that this excess be dedicated to property tax relief.

The centerpiece of the Blue Ribbon report is a revised school funding formula based upon the real input costs of education, rather than on a per-student dollar amount.  This new formula will calculate funding based on a target average teacher salary and a target student-to-teacher ratio.

SD's average teacher salary is just over $40,000.  I am recommending that we set a target average of $48,500.  That is our goal.  At that level, SD would be competitive with our surrounding states.  And we would no longer be 51st in the nation.

As I mentioned, the new formula will also be based on a target student-to-teacher ratio.  To be clear, this is not a measurement of class size.  It is the ratio of students to all instructional staff, including regular classroom teachers and others such as special education teachers.

To replace the current small school factor, a sliding scale will be used to calculate each school district's target ratio.  Districts with 600 students or more will be calculated based on a ratio of 15 students per teacher, or 15-to-1.  Those with 200 students or less will be based on a ratio of 12.5-to-1.  Those between 200 and 600 are on a sliding scale.

Let's look at examples.  Consider a school district with 175 students.  That is less than 200, so this district's state aid is based on a target ratio of 12.5-to-1.  If you divide 175 students by 12.5, that results in a target of 14 teachers.  We have a target average salary of $48,500 so you multiply the target number of teachers -- 14 -- by the target salary.  The formula adds extra to cover benefits and overhead costs to calculate this district's total need.

For a district of 600 students, the calculation works in exactly the same way, but it is based on a ratio of 15-to-1.  If you divide 600 students by 15, the result is 40, so this district needs funding for 40 teachers.  That number is multiplied by the target salary of $48,500, and extra is again added for benefits and overhead.

This formula will drive a more informed discussion of education funding.  Rather than base funding on an arbitrary per student allocation, the debate each year will be based on the appropriate target for the average teacher salary.

This is more transparent for both legislators and citizens and will allow for a better discussion each budget cycle.  When you go home, as legislators, you will be able to demonstrate that school districts are receiving adequate state dollars to reach the target salary.

It is important for school districts to understand what this new formula means, and what it does not mean.

This year, we will be setting a state target of $48,500 for the average teacher salary.  That is approximately $8500 more than the current statewide average.  This does not mean that every teacher will receive $48,500, or that every teacher will receive a raise of $8500.  It also does not mean that every district will achieve that target average or that level of raise.

Here is what the state is offering to school districts:  We will give you enough money so that, if your staff meets your target ratio, you will have enough money to pay your teachers the target average.

But each district will decide exactly how to use the new funding, because the state is not mandating that schools achieve their target student-to-teacher ratio.  Some schools may choose to exceed their ratios and to have more staff than the ratio funds.  That will mean that those schools will spread their new money among more people, give smaller raises, and fail to reach the target average.

But although it is not a mandate, this new formula is creating an expectation.  From the STATE level, we should all expect that the new funding we send to districts will be used to increase teacher salaries.  It may take time for districts to adjust, and we may not achieve the entire $8500 increase in our state average in the first year.  But we should expect significant movement toward that goal, and I will propose specific reporting & accountability measures to allow us to monitor progress for each district.

At the local level, these state targets will also set expectations.  Teachers & parents will expect their schools to achieve significant increases in salaries.  This transparent formula will lead to more informed conversations among school leaders, teachers, parents, and taxpayers about local spending and staffing decisions. It will lead to greater accountability at the local level for decisions that impact teacher salaries.

And if the state is going to expect districts to reach these targets, we need to give school leaders more tools to achieve greater efficiency.  One important way we do this is through the Statewide Center for e-Learning at Northern State University.  This center offers high quality courses at no cost to the school -- the state pays for it.  These offerings are particularly important for districts who struggle to recruit teachers in high-need disciplines.  I am proposing that we expand the offerings at the e-Learning Center so that we can make these high-quality teachers available to more districts.

I also propose that we dedicate funds to incentivize the sharing of services across districts.  The state has already done this successfully in some areas.  For example, the state already negotiates the cost of internet bandwidth centrally and provides it to schools at no cost.  The state also provides a student information system to schools at no cost.  Providing these services have a cost to the state general fund, but they save schools more than they cost the state. In every case, it is voluntary for schools to participate.  But we have found that the vast majority of schools will take advantage of these efficient means to save money.

We can expand this approach to even more areas -- from purchasing, to payroll, to software licensing.  We can even incentivize districts to share staff. And by helping districts save money on these administrative costs, we make it that much easier for them to put more dollars into instructional staff.

The introduction of new money into school funding also creates an opportunity to fix longstanding problems with the formula.  New money means that fixing these problems is not a ""zero sum game.""

For example, we can move to greater equity among districts.  Our current system adds state dollars to school district property taxes.  We send more state dollars to districts which have low property values, and we send less state money to districts with high property values.  In this way we provide a uniform level of funding whether a district has low property values or high. But some school district revenue sources, such as the wind farm tax,

The gross receipts tax on utilities, the bank franchise tax, and the revenue from traffic fines, are ignored in this equalization effort.  This creates unfair ""windfalls"" for certain districts.  The task force recommended that we move toward greater equity in this area, and my proposal would treat these other revenue sources just as property tax values are treated, over a five-year phase-in period.

I am also proposing that the state reinstate caps on school reserve funds.  A reserve is a prudent management tool, but as the state introduces new funds into the system, we should expect that these dollars will be used to increase teacher salaries -- not held in reserves for future years. If a district exceeds the cap, state aid will be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  This would take effect in three years, so schools have time to adjust.

And I will be proposing changes to respond to the dramatic growth of capital outlay in recent years.  Capital outlay is a separate mill levy that schools assess to pay for building construction and maintenance.  Over the past 12 years, while the per-student allocation has increased 25%, school revenues for capital outlay have increased by 117%.  My plan will restrict annual growth to slow that trend.  I am also proposing to make permanent the current law, which had been set to expire in 2018, that allows school districts to shift some of these funds to general operations.  School boards should be able to decide where to spend their dollars, and this will allow a portion of these funds to be used for teacher salaries or for other costs.

Finally, I support recommendations of the task force to improve our ability to recruit and retain teachers.  We will institute reciprocity with other states, so that teachers coming to SD can avoid unnecessary barriers to entering the classroom.  A mentoring program will help new teachers find their way to success, so that fewer new teachers leave the profession in their first years.  And we will restore funding to reward the outstanding teachers who achieve National Board Certification.  This is an important way to recognize our best teachers and to encourage more teachers to pursue this rigorous process.

We all want what is best for our children.  We want to provide them with a quality education.  And we know that requires a strong workforce of great teachers.  This is the year.  This is the year to get out of last place.  This is the year to act.  Let's join together this year to strengthen our schools and keep our promise to the next generation.

S.D. Retirement System

Another important area where we must continue to look ahead is the SD Retirement System.  I am very proud -- and we should all be very proud -- that SDRS is consistently among the best-funded retirement systems in the nation.  We hold ourselves to a very high standard. SDRS targets 100% funding while using among the most conservative measurements of liabilities of any public pension plan.

Other states have taken an opposite approach, which is why nationwide, the average statewide retirement plan is only 75% funded.  Compare that to the SD Retirement System, which, as of June 30, was 104% funded.  While other states have failed to consistently make the contributions their actuaries recommend, SD doesn't fail.

The success of our system has been made possible by the effective and conservative management of the Retirement System Board of Trustees, the outstanding performance of the SD Investment Council, and the cooperation and support of all stakeholders.

Even with these successes, the Board of Trustees is taking a proactive step to improve the sustainability of the plan for the next generation of public employees. At its December board meeting, the Board unanimously approved a new retirement design for new public employees who begin work after June 30, 2017.  The new design accommodates longer life expectancies, adds variable hybrid benefits, and eliminates inequitable subsidies. Those who fall under the new design will not be subsidizing members of the current design -- both plans will be self-sustaining.

This change will not affect current employees -- not now, and not when current employees retire.

This change will not affect those who are already retired.  And this change will not require additional contributions from employees.

The Board's unanimous recommendation is subject to legislative approval, so you will be hearing more about this proposal in the coming weeks.  I strongly urge your approval.  Unlike other states, SD is not waiting for a crisis to tackle this issue.  Our state would strengthen this system now -- when our pension is over 100% funded -- so that our state pension plan will be well-funded through any future challenges.

Medicaid

Last month in the budget address, I spoke to you about the state's continuing conversations with federal officials about Medicaid. Since that time, federal officials have continued to work on the issues surrounding reimbursement to the state for services provided to Indian Health Service enrollees. I just received a detailed letter from the federal Secretary of Health and Human Services in response to our comments on the draft federal policy change, and I believe that by the end of the month we will know if this plan is viable.

Some of you have asked me, ""Why would a conservative Republican governor propose a plan to expand Medicaid?""  In fact, last month the New York Times ran a front page story discussing Medicaid proposals by conservative governors in SD, Utah and Wyoming and comparing their approach with the U.S. Senators from those states.

If I were in Congress, I would be doing exactly what Sen. Thune, Sen. Rounds, and Congresswoman Noem are doing.  The federal healthcare law is about far more than Medicaid expansion, and we are already seeing how it has distorted the market for health insurance and led to higher costs.  The law needs to be repealed or significantly changed.

But at the state level, we do not set federal law or policy.  It is our responsibility to understand the federal programs as they exist, and to make the best decisions for our state.  That is why, although I opposed the federal healthcare reform law, my administration has spent three years discussing possible approaches to expansion with federal officials.

The deal I am proposing makes sense for SD.  It is a good deal.  This plan will fix the longstanding Indian Health Service reimbursement issue, secure better health care for Native Americans, and cover 50,000 more South Dakotans, at no cost to the state.  This change will benefit counties by relieving their indigent care costs, and by reducing the health care costs for jail inmates.  It will reduce the charity care expense that hospitals pass on to other patients.

We all know that Native Americans in our state were promised health care by the federal government as a treaty obligation.  When the federal government fails to meet that obligation, the cost falls on the state.  Consider this story as illustrating the current level of service from IHS.

Gena is a 39-year-old Rosebud Sioux tribal member and a mother of two.  When she was 24 she received a kidney transplant due to a genetic disease.  Gena's grandmother died of cervical cancer, placing Gena at higher risk for this disease.  During Gena's health exam in April 2014 at IHS, some abnormalities were detected.  Given her health history, these results should have raised an immediate red flag.

In fact, Gena didn't learn of this abnormal result until eight months later, through a LETTER, not a phone call.  She immediately called to get an appointment with an IHS gynecologist, only to be told there wasn't one available.  She asked to be referred to an outside specialist, but this was denied because it was not considered a priority 1 ""life or limb"" case.

Fortunately, in Gena's case, she was able to afford to pay out-of-pocket to see a specialist, and although there was no cancer, she must remain vigilant.

A few of you may know Gena.  I know you all know her husband, Senator Troy Heinert.  The Heinerts gave me permission to share this story, so you can understand why we need to do something about the situation with IHS.

If this plan is adopted, the new relationship between IHS and healthcare providers will allow Native Americans to get better health care.  IHS will be able to use telehealth to provide better primary care.  If a Native American is eligible for Medicaid, the state will no longer bear half of the expense for this treaty obligation.

This deal makes sense for SD.  Most of SD's tribes have strongly endorsed this plan, & I believe they all will.

But as I've said before, I will not move forward with this plan unless the State Legislature expresses its support through the passage of a state budget that includes the necessary budget authority.

And I won't support the plan if it will cost the state new general funds.

I know that some of you are concerned about the soundness of the cost projections for this plan.  Given the experience of some other states, that is a very valid concern and you are right to raise that question.  I had the same question myself.

Four years ago, we undertook a survey that indicated that 48,500 South Dakotans would qualify for expansion.  Last fall, we conducted a new survey that updated that number to 49,700.  For comparison, North Dakota has expanded and only added 19,000. For our projections, I added about 10% to be safe -- 55,000 enrollees.

In the states where projections have been wrong, in part it was because those states didn't expect all those eligible to sign up in the first year.  In our projections, we are assuming 100% of them will sign up by the end of the first year.

We have also been conservative in estimating the costs per enrollee.  We believe that each enrollee will cost about $6400 per year.  We calculated that based on actual costs of low income adults in SD's current Medicaid enrollees, but it is also within $20 of the actual costs incurred by expansion states.  To be safe, however, we added 20% to that estimate also and budgeted $7700 per enrollee.

In addition to these safeguards, we are also ignoring that some of the expansion population will be Native American, and therefore eligible for the new IHS reimbursement plan.  That would reduce the cost by up to $15 million.  We will save some of that $15 million, but our assumptions assume none of it.  We are also ignoring the likely positive impact that the new funds will have on the state's economy and our state tax revenues.

Finally, I would support, and I hope you will pass, ""trigger"" language to require that, if the federal government changes the deal, SD would withdraw from expansion.  If a Republican President and Republican Congress are elected in 2016, the federal health care law could be repealed entirely.  Regardless, if the federal funding goes away, so should the program.  Even in that case, however, I am optimistic that our efforts to fix the longstanding IHS reimbursement issue and improvements to health care for Native Americans would remain and the state would continue to benefit from that solution.

I went through that quickly, and I'm sure you still have questions.  Over the past month, I organized four meetings around the state, for legislators, to explain the projections and answer questions.  I am hosting another one later this week.

My request of you is that you wait to pass judgment on this proposal until we receive final word from the federal government.  Take that time to scrutinize our cost estimates and to ask questions.  As I said last month, there are things about Medicaid expansion that bother me also.  But we all owe it to the people of SD to give this complex issue careful consideration this year.  And if the plan comes together to improve health care for Native Americans, and at the same time expand Medicaid with no costs to the state, I hope you will agree that it makes sense for SD.

Public Safety Improvement Act

Three years ago, I first spoke to you about SD's high imprisonment rate for adult offenders -- higher than any of our six neighboring states. Per capita, we were locking up 75% more men than ND and four times as many women as Minnesota. Continuing on that path would have forced the state to build a new women's prison and a new men's prison within 10 years. Worst of all, our high imprisonment rate wasn't making the public any safer.

Today, because of the Public Safety Improvement Act, the prison population is now below initial projections and we saved millions of dollars last year by avoiding the need for a new women's prison. By avoiding the costs of constructing and operating new prisons, SD should save over $100 million in correctional costs this decade.

Also thanks to criminal justice reforms, the parole success rate increased from 37% of offenders in FY12 to 65% in FY15.  Today, parolees can reduce the duration of their parole by a month for each month of parole in which they are 100% compliant. In just one year, over 700,000 days of parole credit were earned.  That's nearly 2,000 years of parole credits earned.

In addition, more non-violent offenders are getting the help they need within their own communities.  Our reforms added new drug and DUI courts throughout the state -- in fact, we increased the number of drug courts by 5 times. Today, over 500 children have a parent who is enrolled in a drug or DUI court. Instead of going to prison, these parents are getting the help they need, while staying in their own homes and supporting their families.

We have also launched a pilot program for parole with the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate.  Under this program, the tribe supervises enrolled parolees on the reservation for the state, so these parolees can return to their homes.  As of last summer, 97% of offenders in the pilot program had not absconded or committed a parole violation.

According to the most recent crime reports from the FBI and our Attorney General, SD's crime rate decreased from 2013 to 2014. Although we can't definitively attribute the reduction in crime to the Public Safety Improvement Act, it's certainly a positive sign.

Experts say that it will take three to five years to see all the results of these reforms. Still, the early data is promising, and I'm hopeful these reforms will save the state money, hold offenders more accountable and make SD an even safer place.

Juvenile Justice Reinvestment Initiative

Last year we also passed a significant reform of our juvenile justice system. The new policies are expected to cut in half the number of youth committed to the Department of Corrections, allowing the state to reinvest in programs and practices that will achieve better outcomes.

The state has been working to prepare for the most significant changes, which became effective January 1st.

The Dept. of Social Services has identified a core set of effective programs to be available in communities.

To date, 12 contracts have been awarded to deliver Functional Family Therapy throughout SD and training for these providers is taking place this month.  This program is designed to address adolescent behavior problems, substance abuse and delinquency, and help families support their children in positive ways.

The Unified Judicial System has been working to ensure judges are aware of the statutory changes that impact them, and that probation officers have the tools they need.  Probation officers will utilize a guide of graduated consequences to hold youth accountable for their conduct by responding consistently and quickly to violations, and also to incentivize positive behavior.

The Department of Corrections has created a financial incentive program to encourage counties to divert juveniles from detention, and yet allow counties to request funds when the number of detention bed days in a given calendar year exceeds an established baseline.

And, a Native American Focus Group was established to determine how state and tribal governments can partner to better serve youth. The group recently held its third meeting and the Department of Tribal Relations reports they have been receiving positive feedback from tribal leaders.

Just as adult system reforms have helped us avoid building new prisons, the juvenile justice reforms are impacting our juvenile corrections facilities.  Over the last few years, the number of juveniles being sent to STAR Academy has been decreasing, and the juvenile justice reforms are expected to reduce those numbers further. We recently closed the STAR Academy's East Campus, at the old Youth Forestry Camp, and consolidated programs at the main campus near Custer.  In the coming year, STAR Academy's programs will be downsized to reflect the smaller population being served there.

In the midst of this downsizing, the STAR Academy staff members have continued to do their jobs with commitment and dedication. In some cases, they may be working themselves out of a job.  Yet staff members continue to work selflessly by placing the needs of the youth ahead of their own.

Workforce

I have also spoken to you several times before about workforce.  SD continues to face a shortage of skilled workers.  I hear from many business owners that they are delaying expansions, and even turning work away, because they simply cannot hire enough people.

We have taken many steps to address this issue over the past few years, and we all understand that this is a marathon, not a sprint.  It needs constant attention.

We have a low unemployment rate, and a nearly 1-to-1 ratio of job seekers to job openings. This seems ideal, but most of those who are seeking jobs don't have the skills needed to perform the jobs available.  We must overcome this misalignment through education.

College Affordability

More than ever before, it's important for young people to continue their education beyond high school.  The Board of Regents recently proposed a goal that 65% of SD young people achieve a post-secondary credential of some sort, and I think it is a worthy goal to pursue.

Students need to be able to attend college or tech school and finish in a reasonable time without an unreasonable debt.  Two years ago we froze tuition to keep schooling affordable.  My proposal this year to freeze tuition again, by using one-time funds to repay debt, will again move us toward tuition affordability.

Our successful state-subsidized dual credit program also pursues this goal.  These are the cheapest credits a student will ever take, and they help make college more affordable. Last school year, SD students saved more than $2.5 million by using this program -- averaging more than $1,000 per student in savings.  Completing college credits while in high school also helps that student succeed in college, by reducing the course load and the time needed to graduate.

The Build Dakota Scholarship is also making postsecondary education an option for more young people.  Just over a year ago, the state announced a partnership with T. Denny Sanford to create a $50 million fund for this full-ride scholarship for those who will work in a high-need technical field in SD.  Last fall, nearly 300 students made up the first class of Build Dakota ""skilled scholars.""  Overall enrollment at the technical institutes went up -- and it went up by even more in these high-demand programs.  Before we know it, the first Build Dakota scholars will be graduating and entering the workforce in SD.

Department of Labor and Regulation initiatives

Of course, young people need good information in high school to help them choose a career path.  The Department of Labor and Regulation recently rolled out a new system which enables people to view employment and wage outcomes, by program, for graduates of our public universities and technical institutes. Students and families can use this tool to make informed decisions on post-secondary programs they are considering. For any degree program, they can find see how many graduates are earning a wage in SD, how much graduates are making on average, and in which industries graduates are employed.

The Department is also overhauling its SDWORKS jobs database. Employers will post openings by the specific skills and competencies required for the job, instead of using job titles and job descriptions. Job seekers will also have a tool to translate their resume into those same skills and competencies. This improvement will ensure there are no missed opportunities in making the match between employers and job seekers.

Employing People with Disabilities  

As we face our workforce shortage, there is an untapped labor pool of people who are ready, willing, and completely able to work. The unemployment rate among Americans with disabilities is over twice the unemployment rate of those without a disability. Even though more of those with disabilities are working in SD, there are still too many South Dakotans with disabilities who want a job but can't find one.

My goal is to make SD an ""employment first state."" This means making employment the first priority and the preferred outcome for our citizens with disabilities. As a part of this employment first effort, we are working to change perceptions through the ""Ability for Hire"" campaign. The campaign launched in August when the Department of Human Services partnered with the SD Retailers Association to educate employers about the process of finding and hiring people with disabilities.

Native American Education

As we look to our next generation, we must not overlook SD's Native Americans.  Last year, I established the Native American Student Achievement Advisory Council to examine the issues impacting the education of Native youth across the state. Our Native American students hold great promise as future leaders in their communities, their tribes, and in our state, but we know that our Native youth continue to underperform.

The council met five times over the course of the year, and the meetings included conversations with students who shared their very personal and powerful stories of struggle, challenge and success. Two important themes that emerged from those conversations were the students' desire for high expectations and the tremendous impact that caring teachers can have on the educational experience.

In December, the council issued its final report and offered several recommendations, including creating a grant program to fund the establishment of up to three pilot schools aimed at improving academic outcomes for Native American students. Council members visited schools in other states, which solidified their vision for an educational experience that incorporates not only academics, but an emphasis on the whole student, including cultural background, and on challenging students while also recognizing their individual interests and skills.

Recognizing the absolutely critical role that teachers play in a student's educational experience, as well as the difficulty of attracting qualified candidates to teach in rural, isolated areas of the state, the council also recommended a program to assist paraprofessionals who already live and work in some of our struggling school districts to become fully certified teachers.

This year I'm recommending we allocate $2.2 million in one-time funds to start these efforts to improve educational outcomes for Native American students.  We need to do better.

Better Government Initiative

Every year, I report to you on our ""Better Government"" initiatives to make state government more efficient, more open, and more accessible.  Over the last five years we've made strides in these areas. Let me just give you a few examples.

The Bureau of Finance and Management has revamped the Open SD web portal so the public can more easily access state financial information.  The bureau also now posts financial metrics to its website each week. We launched the administrative rules website to help citizens find and follow rule making.  We also established the Boards and Commissions Portal, which is the one-stop site for meeting notices, agendas, and information for the more than one hundred state boards and commissions.

We've improved on transparency so much that the US Public Interest Research Group has named SD among the top states for transparency. Since 2011 SD has improved its transparency rating from a D+ to an A-.

My administration has also worked on ""red tape repeal"" efforts.  Over the past five years, we have proposed and you have supported the elimination of over 4,000 sections of obsolete or unnecessary laws and rules, accounting for 450,000 words.  This year, state agencies will be introducing still more bills to continue this effort.  I know from my time as a legislator that the trend is always to add words to the statute books -- thank you for helping remove needless words as well!

Internal Controls

I will also be asking you to support my efforts to improve state government's internal controls.  This has been brought to the forefront by the situation that has unfolded with Mid-Central Coop.  As you know, our Secretary of Education terminated Mid-Central's contract to administer the GEAR UP grant after attempts to improve inaccurate and incomplete accounting failed to bring about improvement.  At my request the Attorney General and the Auditor General are conducting detailed investigations into that matter.

Like every South Dakotan, I am disappointed and disheartened when I learn about allegations of financial wrongdoing.  I am also frustrated at the necessarily slow pace of thorough criminal investigations, and anxious to know the whole story.

When a situation like this arises, it is important to handle it in an open and forthright manner, and that is what I have done.  First, we report to law enforcement and request an investigation.  Second, we do everything possible to aid in that investigation.  Third, we share information with the press and the public as soon as the investigation allows.  And finally, we invite audits and reviews to identify areas to improve and we act quickly to implement those recommendations.

Overall, SD has very good internal controls aimed at safeguarding state government assets and providing assurances that state and federal tax dollars are spent correctly.  However, we have learned that our processes don't go far enough to oversee entities outside of state government.  These grantees or sub-recipients are not part of state government, but may be used by the state to administer federal grants.

The state needs better internal controls to manage these entities that are ""arms length"" to the state.  We must install safeguards that will ensure that federal and state objectives are met, expenditures are documented and appropriate, and potential conflicts of interest are recognized and avoided.

I have asked Lt. Governor Michels to lead an effort to review state government's internal control processes and to recommend changes.  In particular, I have asked him focus on situations involving these ""arms length"" outside entities, such as Mid-Central Coop, where it is more difficult for state government to maintain direct oversight.

Lt. Governor Michels is working closely with the Bureau of Finance and Management and with your Department of Legislative Audit to design internal control reforms to be instituted in every agency that maintains relationships with third parties.  Having these controls in place will identify areas where the state can improve and prevent future problems from occurring.  I hope to have specific recommendations for your consideration during this legislative session.  We can do a better job of providing oversight and transparency in these instances and we will.

State Parks

You know, there are some things about my job that enjoy more than others.  I remember feeling that way as a legislator, too.  Many exciting things are happening in SD right now, & I'd like to share a few of them with you.

I'm very excited about Good Earth State Park at Blood Run.  Three years ago, you approved $2 million to establish our newest state park.  The SD Parks and Wildlife Foundation is in the home stretch of a $7.5 million fundraising effort to match public funds.  This will pay for land acquisition, trail development and a visitor center with exhibits. Trails have been established, native vegetation restoration is underway, and an entrance road has been constructed. Work on the new visitor center is just now beginning where the Native American history of the park will be told in a spectacular building near a wooded area.

Last summer, seizing an unexpected opportunity, the Parks and Wildlife Foundation acquired the Spring Creek Country Club property bordering the park to the south, adding 200 acres to the park, and increasing the state's holdings by 25%.  A portion of this property lies within the Blood Run National Historic Landmark and the preservation of those historic resources will become an important element of the park.  My son, Chris, and I canoed to Good Earth State Park this past summer on the Big Sioux River and it is just as beautiful when viewed from the riverside.

I'm also enthusiastic about all the progress underway at Custer State Park.  Last year, the 50th Buffalo Roundup attracted a record crowd.  Over $3 million of private donations are supplementing the $1.5 million appropriation the legislature made in 2013 and the $500,000 investment from Game, Fish, and Parks.  Contractors are making progress on the park's new visitor center which is scheduled to open this spring. The new visitor center will include a theater where visitors can view a film about the park before exploring it themselves.

Following the Buffalo Roundup last fall, work began on the resort improvements you authorized last year. The motel wings on the State Game Lodge are being remodeled, and fifteen old clapboard sided cabins are being replaced with more spacious and modern units. The Legion Lake store and restaurant are being replaced and upgraded, and three additional reunion-style cabins are being added in the park.  Infrastructure improvements will follow next spring and renovations in the historic portion of the Game Lodge will begin next year.

It is because of the generosity of many people that we are able to build world class facilities at Good Earth State Park and Custer State Park Visitor Center. Thanks to their generosity, as well as the legislature's continued support, these parks will remain world-class destinations for generations to come.

There is another world-class destination in the Black Hills that I'd like to talk to you about today.  Over the last few months, the Spearfish Canyon Foundation has been working with the state Game, Fish, and Parks Department to acquire beautiful property from Homestake Mining Company.  Within just a few weeks the Foundation will donate funds to Game, Fish and Parks for the purchase of 72 acres in Spearfish Canyon, including Spearfish Falls.  That land, along with two other adjacent state-owned parcels including Roughlock Falls, is the genesis of this opportunity.

My hope is to establish Spearfish Canyon State Park in the northern Black Hills.  The proposed state park would contain iconic natural features in the canyon including Roughlock Falls, Spearfish Falls, Spearfish Creek, Little Spearfish Creek, and fishing ponds. Game, Fish and Parks would improve existing camping, hiking, fishing, and sightseeing opportunities and upgrade facilities and roads.

Spearfish Canyon is a special place.  Our family has visited many times.  I remember being there when Spearfish Falls was restored.  Water flow that now feeds the falls had been diverted for 86 years for use in hydro-power generation for the Homestake Mining Company.  In 2003, Homestake returned water to the stream and the long-quiet and dry falls were reborn.  I remember riding my bike up Spearfish canyon, climbing the never ending hill near Cheyenne crossing into Lead-Deadwood and then experiencing the thrill going down the hill at full speed. Whether on a snowmobile ride in the winter, a hiking trip in the summer, or a day enjoying the beautiful colors of the fall foliage, many people from across the state and nation have fond memories of Spearfish Canyon.  The famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright, said this after his visit in 1935:

But how is it that I've heard so little of this miracle and we, toward the Atlantic, have heard so much of the Grand Canyon when this is even more miraculous. My hat is off to South Dakota Treasures.

I am very excited about making Spearfish Canyon more accessible as our newest state park; but we have many steps to go before this vision become a reality. Senator Thune is leading an effort by our congressional delegation to authorize a federal-state land exchange. This isn't a certainty, but we're working on it, and I'm hopeful.  This map shows in green the property which the state owns or will acquire with the Spearfish Canyon Foundation.  The outline shows the surrounding National Forest land, which we hope to add to it, to comprise the larger Park.  The state has been instrumental in the past in improving Spearfish Canyon and I believe this plan will carry on that tradition to preserve and improve this jewel for future generations.

""Dignity"" statue at Chamberlain

Another exciting project is figuratively on the horizon today, but will be literally on the horizon this fall.  If you're driving east on Interstate 90, and beginning to cross the Missouri River bridge near Chamberlain, you will see something very striking on the eastern horizon.  I'm talking about a 50-foot stainless steel statue, called ""Dignity,"" which will be placed on the high bluff near the Lewis and Clark I-90 rest area near Chamberlain.

As a gift to the people of SD, and as a tribute to SD's Native people, Norm and Eunabel McKie of Rapid City commissioned SD Artist Laureate, Dale Lamphere, to design and create this sculpture of a Native American woman receiving a star quilt.  This sculpture will be lit at night, and just as Mt. Rushmore and Crazy Horse have become iconic images in the mind of our visitors, I'm sure ""Dignity"" will become one as well.  The statue will be in unveiled in September.

Rail

I'd like to speak for a moment about SD's railroads.  Rail may not be as visible as our state parks, but I am very excited by the progress our state has made in developing rail infrastructure. Because South Dakotans consume only a modest share of the grain we produce, our state relies almost entirely on railroads to deliver our grain to out-of-state markets.

In October the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded the RCP&E Railroad a $6 million TIGER grant to upgrade its line near Huron and to install a long siding near Philip.  A siding project might seem insignificant until you know the situation.  Today, between Ft. Pierre and Rapid City, that 165-mile stretch of rail has no siding long enough for head-to-head trains to pass each other.  A train leaving Ft. Pierre forces a train in Rapid City to wait for the Ft. Pierre train to reach Rapid City before the other may start eastward.  Construction of the new siding will allow up to 100 more trains per year to run over this section.

This good news follows the state's launch, just over a year ago, of four other rail projects in SD.  Two of these projects involved sidings in Huron and Aurora and reconstruction of a portion of the Sioux Valley line in southeastern SD.

A larger project will upgrade the Britton Line in northeast SD.  This $11.5 million project will construct the south leg of a ""Y"" at Jarret Junction and replace 29 miles of light rail with heavy rail, to enable it to handle modern traffic.  Dirt work for the ""Y"" is complete. Final delivery of heavy rail will be in March, and installation will begin in the spring. A $30 million grain terminal in Britton is under construction, prompted by these rail improvements.

Another $35 million rail project was supported in part by the legislature's appropriation of $7.3 million.  This is reconstructing the state-owned line, which, between Chamberlain and Presho, has been unusable for many years.  Here is a picture of how badly that line has deteriorated over the past decades. Work on the smaller bridges is on schedule with 93% of work complete east of Reliance and the balance to be finished by the end of March.  The Missouri River bridge work is substantially complete with minor punch list items remaining. Culvert repairs are 100% complete. 100% of the ties, rail, joint bars, tie plates, anchors and bolts are on hand. Rail, but not ties, is in place from near Reliance to east of Kennebec and installation will resume in the spring. The contractor is installing rail first and then will go back to install ties, and we anticipate an operating railroad by this fall.  A $40 million grain and fertilizer terminal, prompted by this rail improvement, will be complete this fall as well.

Sanford Underground Research Facility

I'm also pleased about the Sanford Underground Research Facility at the former Homestake mine.  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, and the associated Long Baseline Neutrino Facility, made great progress toward fruition during the past year. The proposed experiment will fire a beam of neutrinos from Fermilab outside Chicago, through the earth, to the Sanford lab. There, this very large experiment will house huge detectors to give scientists information never before collected about neutrinos.   Congress has appropriated funding to complete the rehabilitation of the Ross Shaft, to install rock handling equipment, and to make other site preparations for this monumental experiment.  We are hopeful that funding for the project will be included in the President's FY17 budget proposal next month. Our state's investment in the facility, and your continued support, has put the lab in an unprecedented position to succeed.

Veterans Home and Korean War Medals

Finally, I'm very excited to report that, tomorrow, residents will move into the new State Veterans Home in Hot Springs.  Many of you were here in 2013 to support construction of this new home, and you know it has not been easy. Our first request for federal grant support was denied.  Then, even as we overcame that setback, the initial bids for construction were millions of dollars beyond architectural estimates and available funds.

The Lieutenant Governor and SD Department of Veterans Affairs spent many hours considering alternative designs and working with the VA. After months of long meetings, the federal VA agreed to extend the state's grant, giving us time to reduce the cost of the project without additional state funds.

Now, the State Veterans Home is finally finished. It has been completed on time, under budget, and it is debt-free. It is a beautiful building and a fitting tribute to our veterans.  A grand opening event is planned for the spring.

For the past two years, the SD Department of Veterans Affairs has been on a mission to contact all veterans in SD.  With over 70,000 veterans, this has been a challenging undertaking.  This year, the Department is focused on contacting veterans of the Korean War.  Over 60 years have passed since the Korean armistice was signed. Wedged between World War II and Vietnam, the Korean War has been referred to as ""the Forgotten War.""

To thank our heroes and to let them know they are not forgotten, the Republic of Korea is awarding Ambassador of Peace medals to all American veterans who sacrificed for South Korea's freedom.

Hundreds of those medals will be conferred today, here at the Capitol, and across SD.

Joining us today from South Korea is the Honorable Sungchoon Park, the Minister of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, along with his staff.  Let's welcome them to SD.

Following today's State of the State address, I invite all of you to join us in the rotunda, where hundreds of SD veterans will receive the ""Korean Ambassador for Peace Medal.""  The ceremony will start promptly at 2:30.

Conclusion

South Dakotans can be very proud of our state.  I am proud that, in SD, we have stayed true to our values. We have exercised frugality and good stewardship rather than following the path taken by so many other states.

We remain self-reliant while coming to the aid of our neighbors when they need a hand.

And look where those values have brought us. Our budget is structurally balanced. We have no unfunded liabilities. Standard & Poor's has upgraded our credit rating to AAA.  We've made new investments in our roads, rails, schools, and Medicaid providers.  We are keeping up our Capitol Building and other state facilities through regular maintenance.  We have comprehensively reformed our criminal justice and juvenile corrections systems.  Our tax burden is low; our regulations are reasonable; and our stellar business climate is bringing in companies like AGP, Advance Health, SpecSys, Lehigh Defense, and Midwest Fresh Logistics.

We must continue to govern by our values.  I remain committed to our values and to making the tough choices to meet the challenges we face.  We will join together to meet these challenges and to serve our state.  I am proud of what we have accomplished together over the last five years and I am looking forward to the work ahead.  I continue to believe that SD's best days are yet to come.",TRUE,Executive Address,02/12/16 09:27 AM
111166,1038152,Governor Terry McAuliffe Delivers State of the Commonwealth Address,01/13/16,1,"Lieutenant Governor Northam, Attorney General Herring, Speaker Howell, Leader Norment, men and women of the General Assembly, distinguished guests, citizens of Virginia -- thank you for inviting me to be with you tonight.

A special thanks to my wife, Dorothy, for all that she is doing for Virginia's children and their families.

I also ask that we all take a moment to thank the 575 brave Virginians in the National Guard who are away from their families this evening, deployed in the UAE, Cuba, Kuwait and elsewhere to keep us all safe.

The head of our Guard is here tonight. Thank you, Major General Tim Williams.

And finally, I welcome the new members of the General Assembly as you begin your first legislative session. I look forward to working with all of you.

When I stood before you one year ago, we were preparing to close a $2.4 billion dollar budget shortfall. We were coping with the drag that federal cuts were placing on our economy and bracing for the potential disaster of another, tougher round of sequestration. And I was speaking through the pain of 7 broken ribs and a punctured lung.

This evening, I am happy to tell you that things are looking up.

Our work to build a new Virginia economy is paying off. We can breathe more freely thanks to a period of relative calm in Washington.

And I'm happy to say that five of my ribs are now healed, and I am certainly breathing more freely than I was a year ago.

Secretary Brown often says that Virginia's leaders are on their best behavior in a budget crisis. And he has seen a few.

We proved his point last year.

When our finances turned ugly, we went to work.

We toughed it out, protecting our schools from cuts and keeping our economic development plans on track.

We did not agree on everything -- but we put partisan battles aside, and we got the job done.

Since then, I've seen many of you at groundbreaking ceremonies for new businesses and factory expansions across the Commonwealth.

Each time, I handed you a shovel and said, ""Let's get to work.""

This evening, let's get those shovels out again and continue working together now that our fortunes have improved.

Last year we worked together to protect and expand our investments in priorities that contribute directly to our goal of a stronger economy. We also agreed on the need to reform programs that were failing.

Those principles should continue to guide our work through this year.

I have introduced a budget that is structurally and fiscally sound.

We must maintain that balanced budget while making strategic investments. Even as our economy improves and our revenues increase, our responsibility to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars remains the same.

And so does the significant power that we in this room have to make a real difference in the lives of the people who sent us here to represent them.

We can change lives by giving the high school student who is uncertain about his future the training he needs to get a great job in cybersecurity.

We can change lives by helping the small business owner make the connections that she needs to sell to customers in China, India and Cuba.

We can change lives by giving a Mom with diabetes the medical care that she needs to stay healthy and to be there for her children.

Those positive changes are at the very heart of the work that we have undertaken together to build a new Virginia economy so that all citizens have the opportunity to maximize their God-given potential.

Henry Ford once said, ""It has been my observation that most people get ahead during the time that others waste.""

I know from my own career in business that you cannot take opportunities for granted. If you pass one up, you may not get another.

The same is true for leading this great Commonwealth. The reprieve that we have received from sequestration cuts is our chance to lay a solid foundation for the type of economy that we will need when those cuts return in full force in two short years.

If we work together over the next 60 days, we can expand economic opportunity to Virginians in every corner of the Commonwealth and from every walk of life. And we can show the world yet again that here in Virginia, we do not back down from a challenge. We do not let petty partisan squabbles stand in the way of the progress our families deserve.

Tonight I am here to tell you that the state of our Commonwealth is strong, and that by working together for the next 60 days we can make it even stronger.

And so this evening, that is the vision that defines my message to you. Let us work together to get things done.

Let's work together to create jobs and build a new Virginia economy.

Let's work together to transform our education and workforce development systems to meet the demands of our future.

Let's work together to make Virginia more attractive to businesses and trading partners all over the globe.

Let's work together to make a real difference in the lives of the friends and neighbors we came here to serve.

Just look back on what we have accomplished as a Commonwealth over the past two years -- and reflect on the lives that we've changed along the way. One Virginian at a time, day after day.

88,400 new jobs created
1,523 veterans with a safe, warm place to call home
100,000 students now attending schools that offer free meals to all children
And more than 37,000 individuals receiving workforce credentials last year alone.
I started this job convinced that all of our Commonwealth's challenges trace back to one essential solution: building a new Virginia economy, one that is diverse, sustainable and offers new opportunities for everyone. And the progress that we are making together is a clear indication that we are on the right path to meeting those challenges and beginning a new chapter of opportunity and prosperity.

Think about our accomplishments over the past two years:

561 new economic development projects
A record $9.27 billion dollars in capital investment
The lowest unemployment rate in the Southeast.
The lowest level of initial unemployment claims in 41 years.
An increase in the average weekly wage from $878 to $941.
And more than 3,848,000 jobs in Virginia, the largest number in the history of the Commonwealth.
State revenues are growing stronger every day in everything from personal income to sales taxes to housing sales.

And I want you to know that I did buy a Powerball ticket, so when I win later tonight, we're going to see a $40 million spike in state revenues.

As we've grown our economy overall, we've also sharpened our competitive edge in high-growth industries like cybersecurity and biosciences.

Last month, Virginia beat out 46 other states for a new Air Force Cyber Operations Squadron, to be located at Langley Air Force Base.

And tomorrow I will be in Northern Virginia to cut the ribbon for VISA's new state-of-the-art cyber fusion center, which will provide threat detection and command and control operations for the world's largest payment network.

I am proud that Virginia beat out Colorado and Texas for this major economic development project.

Here in Virginia, we've also steadily accelerated our push to increase exports of all Virginia products and services to global markets.

Why? Because 95 percent of global customers live outside of the United States, and 81% of all global economic growth will occur outside the U.S. through 2020.

We have visited those markets personally, opening up India to Virginia-grown apples for the first time in history.

And we have worked to lift the bans on poultry exports to Oman and Kuwait.

Just this week, we received our first ever order for two containers of poultry to be shipped to Oman.

And last week, we traveled to Cuba, where we were able to forge a deal between Virginia's port and the new $1 billion dollar Port of Mariel.

We've also assisted 692 Virginia companies eager to tap international markets through our trade programs.

And 182 of those businesses have traveled overseas to make personal connections with new customers and new opportunities.

With us tonight is Vanessa Christie, Vice-President of the Virginia Beach-based company Prevailance, with more than 100 employees.  Vanessa is a U.S. Navy combat veteran who spent the majority of her active duty time flying and instructing in the F-14 Tomcat.  Her company has historically provided engineering and flight services to the Pentagon and NATO, but now it is moving into international markets.

In the first year of participation in our VALET program, Vanessa has joined our trade missions to the UK, Canada and Mexico, and she has six return business trips scheduled to these international markets this year.  This is a defense contractor who is diversifying and creating jobs for Virginians. Thank you for being here tonight, Vanessa, and thank you for your service to our nation.

We've also worked together to strengthen Virginia's agriculture exports.

Last year, we exported a record $3.35 billion dollars in ag products, which moved us up to the Number 2 spot on the East Coast -- leapfrogging North Carolina and putting Georgia squarely in our sights. Despite strong global headwinds, we remain focused on meeting my goal of making Virginia the number one ag exporting port on the East Coast.

Our successes in global trade are at the center of the important work that we are doing to build a new Virginia economy -- and they are a clear example of the benefits of working together to get things done. The support of Delegate Landes, Senator Hanger and many others for our economic development funding, such as Virginia trade programs and AFID, gives us the tools we need to open new markets for businesses and producers across the Commonwealth.

I am pleased to see that there is bipartisan backing for the $38.9 million dollars in our budget to partner with Go Virginia as it fosters regional collaboration among businesses, government and education leaders to help us achieve our shared economic goals.

These are not partisan successes -- they are Virginia successes, and I believe that we are just warming up.

As we ship Virginia products to trade partners all over the globe, we are also making great progress in strengthening our energy economy and diversifying our fuel mix here at home.

We recently announced a historic 80 megawatt solar facility that will power Amazon Web Services' data centers in Northern Virginia.

This will be the largest solar facility in the mid-Atlantic and the second largest on the East Coast.

It will more than quadruple the amount of solar currently installed in the Commonwealth.

We are also doing our part to power up the solar industry in Virginia with our goal to purchase 8 percent of the electricity needed to run state government from solar generation within the next three years.

Friends, that is a 100-fold increase in our solar usage.

We will make Virginia more energy independent and stimulate economic growth by expanding our use of renewable energy.

Recently, we met with the leaders from Microsoft, Google and Amazon, and they made it perfectly clear that they will only do business and create jobs in states that can provide renewable energy to power their operations. Renewables also offer an opportunity for our manufacturing sector, so that every single solar panel or wind turbine we install has ""Made in Virginia"" stamped right on it.

I'm proud of what we've achieved over the past two years in building Virginia's economy, and the budget I presented to you in December takes even more aggressive steps to build on our momentum. According to an analysis by Chmura Economics and Analytics, our $2.43 billion dollar bond package alone will be a major boost to our economy, generating

$3.5 billion dollars in economic impact through 2021 from construction expenditures.
More than 19,000 new jobs, primarily in construction and related industries
And the largest capital investment in research in our history, with an emphasis on emerging sectors like bioscience.
Nearly $850 million dollars in bonds are designated for our four-year universities and $214 million dollars for community colleges to strengthen and expand STEM and workforce programs.

In addition to significant capital investments in research and development, the two-year budget before you provides more than $1 billion dollars in new funds across all levels of education.

We have proposed a significant infusion of resources into our public schools, including $139 million dollars to fund 2,500 additional instructional positions.

We will take Virginia's investment in public education to $6.78 billion dollars in fiscal year 18, the highest level in the Commonwealth's history.

Now, this does not mean that we should invest taxpayer dollars in education just for the sake of it. We should invest in smart, innovative programs that get results for the students, communities and the businesses that we serve.

We've already made a great start.

Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam and his team worked closely with us to win a $17.5 million dollar annual grant from the U.S. Department of Education to provide high-quality pre-kindergarten classes for 13,000 children.

We began reforming our Standards of Learning by eliminating 5 SOL tests. We made the testing process better without watering down the high standards that we set for our schools and our students.

My team worked closely with leaders in this room like Senator John Miller and Delegate Tag Greason to oversee these important reforms, and the results speak for themselves:

5-point gains in reading and math pass rates
Improvements in writing, science and history
A 7-point increase in math pass rates among African-American students, and a 6-point gain in reading
And today, 1, 414 of our public schools are fully accredited -- a 10 percentage point increase in just one year.

But now is not the time to let up.

Let us use these 60 days to strengthen our investment in education, further reform our Standards of Learning and make every single Virginia classroom a place where students are being prepared to lead in the 21st century.

We can start by using new technologies to evaluate student learning without subjecting them to 6-hour SOL tests.

If we work together to provide the necessary resources, by the spring of 2017 we can reduce the time most Virginia students spend taking SOL tests to less than 2 hours through computer adaptive testing.

As important as it is to reduce and shorten tests, it is just a small piece of the work that we must do to build the education system that we need to lead in a global economy. Virginia's students hold the key to innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth -- what we put into our schools today will be what we get out of our economy 10, 20 and 50 years from now.

You cannot build an economy for 2050 with a 1950s approach to education.

So this year, I have proposed legislation to begin a fundamental change in Virginia's approach to high school education.

We will put greater emphasis on hands-on learning, internships, early college courses and industry credentials, rather than classroom seat-time.

Our high schools were designed during the Industrial Revolution to prepare workers with the basic information and skills needed for the jobs of that day and time.

This is a particularly urgent matter for more than 2 million Virginians living in rural regions.

As Governor Jerry Baliles has noted in his work on the Rural Virginia Horseshoe Initiative, 21 percent, or more than 400,000 rural residents, have less than a high school diploma.

Our educators are eager to create the schools of the future, and they're already starting. Here in the Richmond area, a new CodeRVA school is opening next fall that will prepare students to learn code writing. Students will obtain a high school diploma in two years and get a two-year degree at a community college while working in real-world computer science jobs.

The students who graduate from this school won't have any trouble finding a job.

To all the parents watching tonight, we have 17,000 cyber jobs open with an average starting pay of $88,000.

For those of us old enough to remember the movie, The Graduate, the key word then was ""plastics."" Today, it's ""cyber.""

These new high schools that we are designing will benefit students like James DeLoach, an 8th grader in Goochland County who is already a skilled coder and has even designed an award-winning app. Let's welcome James, who is here with us this evening.

If we are going to prepare students for the jobs of today and create the jobs of tomorrow, we must fundamentally change the way we think about education.

That innovative approach should even extend to the services we offer to students who face unique challenges, like military-dependent children transitioning to new lives here in our Commonwealth. We passed legislation last year to ensure that our schools are doing everything to support the concerns of children of our active-duty military families as they transfer in and out of our public schools. I want to thank the First Lady for her leadership on this issue.

And as we take a new approach to public education, we cannot ignore the fundamental problem that too many students, one in six in fact, lack the basic nutrition they need to fulfill their potential.

I am proud of the progress that we have made on this important issue thanks to our First Lady's outreach and advocacy. Today 100,000 Virginia students in 26 school divisions are now benefitting from the community eligibility provision, which allows schools to provide meals at no cost to the students or their families.

Across the nation, school participation in this new federal program expanded by 20 percent. Here in Virginia the rate was 139 percent!

We worked together last year to include funding in the budget to support school breakfast programs across Virginia, ensuring that all children start their day ready to learn.

Those dollars are helping 244 schools expand their breakfast programs.

But we had an additional 310 schools seek funding that we were not able to support.

I want to recognize a special guest who's also with us tonight; Amanda Warren is the Supervisor of School Nutrition Programs at Staunton City Public Schools.

Out of four schools that applied, two were approved to receive additional support for school breakfast.  At Bessie Weller Elementary School, Amanda has been able to increase breakfast participation among her students from 33 percent to 91 percent! Can you imagine what she could do with funding for all four schools!

That's why the budget before you doubles the funding to $2 million dollars so that we can continue our work getting every student the basic nutrition that he or she needs to succeed in the classroom.  Thank you, Amanda, for being here tonight.

A strong K-12 system in which every student has access to a world-class education is essential to building a new Virginia economy. But we cannot stop there.

The budget we will work on together also contains funding to make our higher education system more accessible to all students, and to better prepare those students for the economy of the future. In this budget, we invest:

More than $48 million new dollars to financial aid for higher education over the next two years.
More than $50 million dollars in incentives for colleges and universities to increase the number of students receiving degrees.
And almost $25 million dollars for Virginia's community colleges to produce more industry certifications and occupational licenses.
I believe that education is a prime example of the opportunity that we have this session to work together to strengthen our economy and make our state a better place to live. We all agree that is what Virginians sent us here to do.

That is why I remain optimistic. If we sit down at the table together in good will, we can find a way forward together on the important issue of Medicaid expansion.

Each day that we do not close the coverage gap, we forfeit $6.6 million dollars in federal money.  Each month we are wasting $15 million in costs to state taxpayers that could be covered entirely with federal dollars. 

Just yesterday, Louisiana became the 31st state to expand coverage, along with the District of Columbia. They are now reaping economic, budgetary and quality-of-life benefits that we continue to leave on the table.

Just this past week, I met with Governor Herbert, the chairman of the National Governors Association. He is pushing to expand coverage in the conservative state of Utah.  He is at least the third conservative Republican governor who has asked me, with surprise in his voice, ""Why wouldn't you bring your own money home to get health care for your citizens?""

I am convinced that we can find a bipartisan, Virginia solution that totally protects our Commonwealth's finances while taking advantage of this historic opportunity to make our state a better place to live.

I ask that you review the details of our plan with an open mind and work with me to reach a resolution that will benefit our constituents, our hospitals and our communities.

As I have said before, my door is always open. And history is on our side.

We have come together over and over again on many important issues, including support for our veterans.

Our Virginia Values Veterans program has helped to connect more than 13,000 veterans with companies eager to hire them.

By 2018, we will reach our goal to help 20,000 veterans find jobs and keep them and their skills here in the Commonwealth.

In partnership with Senator Louise Lucas and Leader Kirk Cox, we also secured funding for two new veteran care centers in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads.

And Virginia was the first and so far the only state in the nation to be certified as functionally ending veteran homelessness.

Anthony Harris is here with us this evening on behalf of the hundreds of volunteers and professionals who worked hard to achieve this goal.

Anthony is a Portsmouth native who served in the Army and now works at Virginia Supportive Housing.

He spent months working with one particular veteran who was living in a tent in Virginia Beach.

I am happy to tell you that Anthony was able to find this man a home by Thanksgiving.

This is not a one-time accomplishment. Virginia is committed to making sure that veteran homelessness is a rare, brief and non-recurring experience from this day forward.

We have put in place a community-based response and service system for identifying these individuals and quickly meeting their needs. 

I feel good knowing that whenever a veteran faces a crisis in the future, he or she can be assured that people like Anthony will be there to help. Thank you, Anthony.

Together, we can expand on these accomplishments and make meaningful investments that strengthen Virginia's position as the most veteran-friendly state in America.

When we came into office promising to transform government and put taxpayers first, our transportation team had a pretty good idea that they were going to be busy. They were right:

We've turned the Port around, generating $13.6 million dollars in profits last year, the first time in seven years that this vital economic asset wasn't floundering in a sea of red.
On the Midtown-Downtown Tunnel project, we eased the toll burden for low-income motorists and eliminated tolls entirely on the Martin Luther King Expressway.
On 460, we canceled the project and negotiated a settlement that saved our taxpayers $149 million dollars.
We have also made great progress in unlocking Northern Virginia from the congestion that keeps this dynamic region from reaching its full potential.

We are adding new lanes to Interstate 66, which will allow 70,000 more people to move through the corridor each day. We are finally putting an end to the wheel-spinning that has kept this much-needed project from moving forward.

I know there has been a lot of misleading information about this issue, but the facts are clear: After years of inaction, commuters will now have new options that will ease congestion without imposing new tolls on drivers for getting to work the same way that they always have.

And it is just one of the steps we have taken to unlock the Northern Virginia region. We are making life better for commuters by extending the 395 HOT Lanes North to the district line, extending the southbound lanes two miles to clear backups in Stafford County and continuing to support the Silver Line to Dulles and other locations in Loudoun.

Together these projects will strengthen the economy of this key region and our entire Commonwealth.

We have also partnered to strengthen our pension funds for the long term.

Thanks to bipartisan cooperation, thousands of public servants can rest assured that their retirement benefits are on firm footing.

I know that this issue is always on the minds of Speaker Howell and Chairman Chris Jones. Indeed, the Speaker has proposed the creation of a commission to explore the future of the Virginia Retirement System, and I hope that the funds in my budget can be a starting point for moving us toward a stable and sustainable program.

As a first step, I hope that we will work together to fully fund our pension contribution rates by the end of the coming biennium, which will be two years ahead of schedule.

We are all equally committed to supporting our current state workers.

I am proud to be their boss, and I was proud to include pay raises in my budget for our state employees, troopers, college faculty and staff, teachers and school personnel, deputies and other state-supported workers. These men and women work hard to make Virginia the best place on Earth to live, work and start a business, and they deserve a raise.

As you know, it took a lot of hard work to reach agreement on ethics reform last year -- but we got it done. And now that the ban on gifts exceeding $100 has taken effect, our constituents can feel more confident that we are acting in their best interests.

To build on this important work, we are proposing campaign finance reforms that would prohibit legislators from fundraising during the veto session and special sessions.

As I did with the gift ban, I will lead by example and introduce legislation that would ban fundraising by governors during the period when they are reviewing bills for approval or veto.

And finally, we are introducing legislation to prohibit the personal use of campaign funds. These are significant steps we can take together to send a clear message to Virginians that we are using the offices they've entrusted to us for one purpose alone: Making their lives better.

Transparency and accountability are key to keeping elected officials connected with the people we serve. And so is ensuring that every Virginian who is qualified to vote has the opportunity to do so as soon as possible. 

Some of the most meaningful moments in my two years as Governor have been the times when I have restored the civil rights of men and women, many of whom have struggled for years to reach that goal.

We have knocked down barrier after barrier, reducing the waiting period, shortening the application forms, eliminating fees and spreading the word that we welcome you and we want you to succeed.

Secretary Levar Stoney and his team have done an amazing job, and I am proud to announce tonight that a record 16,000 Virginians have now had their rights restored since I took office. This is more than the last three governors combined over their full four-year terms.

I'd love to invite all 16,000 of them to be here this evening, but that would be the equivalent of inviting the entire city of Williamsburg.

But Bobby Blevins is here tonight to represent them all.

Bobby lost his rights more than six decades ago when he was just a teenager.

I met Bobby shortly after his 79th birthday and had the honor of personally restoring his rights.

He was in tears when he told me that he had felt like half a citizen for all those years. But on that day, he became a full citizen and on Election Day, Bobby Blevins went to the polls and voted for the first time in his life.

Thank you, Bobby, for being here with us tonight.

We also need to reach out to young people and quickly get them back on the right path when they commit a crime.

Our old juvenile justice model was a failure.

We spend about $186,000 on each juvenile who ends up in a Virginia correctional institution, and almost 80 percent are rearrested within three years of release.

That's why our Department of Juvenile Justice is taking a new approach that emphasizes treatment, education and preparation for a productive life outside the criminal justice system.

We've already reduced the population in our juvenile correctional centers from 600 to 350.

Our budget builds on our success with a plan that will invest savings in diversion and community-based services.

I know that some of the young people in the system have committed serious offenses, but I also know that they are capable of great achievements.

On the Friday before Christmas, a group of young men from Beaumont Juvenile Correctional Center came to the executive mansion to present Dorothy and me with a beautiful quilt that they had designed and created under the direction of their teacher, Roy Mitchell. That quilt, which required almost a year of work, is on display in the lobby of the Patrick Henry Building, and Roy is here as my guest. Thank you, Roy, and your team, for helping so many young people to learn valuable skills and to view the promise of their lives in terms of classrooms and boardrooms, not courtrooms and jailhouses.

On Friday, 73 new troopers and one special agent graduated in Virginia's 123rd class at the State Police Basic Academy.

We depend on these men and women to be there in a crisis, and they depend on us to provide them with adequate resources and to establish commonsense policies in support of public safety.

That is why I stood with the leaders of the Virginia State Police, sheriffs and police chiefs to announce our Executive Order 50, designed to better enforce gun laws that are already on the books.

I am pleased that Attorney General Mark Herring and Secretary Brian Moran are chairing our Joint Strike Force to Prosecute Gun Crimes.

It is my hope that we can work together on reasonable solutions that will save lives.

We should be proud of what we've accomplished and ready to meet the challenges that we still face together.

When I travel around the Commonwealth to the factory floors, the classrooms and the chamber of commerce breakfasts, I find that Virginians are practical, honest people who want their government to focus on its essential duties and to perform them well.

They want quality schools, good roads, reasonable taxes, a meaningful safety net and sound economic policies that will stand the test of time for their children and their grandchildren.

You will see their influence on every page of our budget and in every bill that we will introduce this winter.

Our ideas and proposals are not partisan, nor should they be controversial. I do not expect that you will accept every single one of them, but I am optimistic that our work will be defined more by cooperation than by conflict.

I hope that same approach will be reflected in the bills that you send to me for consideration as this session progresses.

I am ready to work with you on your proposals that will grow our economy, expand opportunity, make our government work better and take better care of our taxpayer dollars.

But I will not hesitate to veto legislation that I believe harms those important goals. Specifically, I am prepared to veto bills that roll back the progress that we have made on marriage equality and women's access to health care.

I will also reject proposals that limit this Commonwealth's ability to keep Virginians safe from gun violence or to react to the very clear and present danger of climate change and sea level rise.

Even more important, I do hope that we will treat our newest Supreme Court justice with the respect that she deserves as a jurist who has served our Commonwealth with honor for 22 years.

Allowing politics to deny this qualified and distinguished jurist a full 12-year term would send a dangerous message about this Commonwealth's respect for the independence of the judicial branch.

It is my hope that our work together this session will be devoted to productive areas where there is room for compromise, and not political sideshows that distract from matters that demand our urgent attention.  So let us resolve this evening to spend as much of this important session as possible laying a solid foundation for the new Virginia economy our families deserve.

If we are to reach that goal, each of us has an important job to do.

We must stay focused on our long-term goals.

We must demand more of ourselves and each other.

And we must always remember why we were elected to office in the first place.

On this first day of this legislative session, we face a crucial decision that will guide us for the next 60 days.

I ask you to make a commitment this evening to find a way.

Find a way to bulldoze through barriers and move Virginia's economy forward.

Find a way to provide all Virginians with the education and training that they need for a good job.

Find a way to build the critical infrastructure to sustain our momentum.

Find a way to change lives for the better.

Right now, at this moment, we can make the right choice and take the next step forward. Together.

Let's get to work.

Thank you, and God bless the greatest state in the greatest nation on Earth.

1716,1038175,State of the State Address,01/13/16,1,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, members of the Board of Public Works, justices of the Supreme Court of Appeals, members of the Legislature, distinguished guests, and my fellow West Virginians.

Five years ago, when I first addressed this chamber as governor, I called on our state's Legislature to get to work and put West Virginia first.

Although many things have changed, including the makeup of this Legislature, our commitment to the people who call our beautiful state home has remained steadfast. Since 2011, we have created a number of new opportunities for future generations, and we have faced our fair share of challenging times.

Tonight, our state is at a crossroads, and I stand before you with a plan that preserves the best of our past while charting a bold new plan for our future.

Since 2011, we have welcomed more than 250 companies and $10 billion in major investments, providing hardworking West Virginians with more 11,000 good-paying jobs.

We've worked hard to create a business climate that makes West Virginia a strong competitor for major economic development projects. And we're not just competing, we're seeing huge success. Nationally and internationally recognized companies like Macy's, Amazon, Quad Graphics and Toyota already know that West Virginia is a great place to do business.

And tonight, I'm proud to announce polymer additive company Addivant has reaffirmed its commitment to our state and plans to expand.

After receiving FDA approval for a groundbreaking polymer to be used in food packaging, the company was on the hunt for a new location to expand its production facility. Major players from the Gulf Coast actively pursued Addivant, but our state's Development Office stepped up and showed company executives that West Virginia is the right place to invest.

This new expansion project not only saves nearly 100 jobs, but it brings at least $12 million in new investments and additional opportunities for employment. Plastics manufacturing is just one of the downstream industries we are working to attract, and this expansion project is just the beginning of that growth.

Addivant chose to stay in West Virginia because of our strong business climate and a highly trained experienced workforce that's ready to get to work.

These types of investments don't happen overnight. They're a result of the hard work and positive changes we've made over the years.

We overhauled workers' compensation, and companies operating here have saved more than $323 million since the program was privatized in 2006. We've reformed medical malpractice and improved our legal climate. We've enacted gradual reductions in our business and consumer taxes, and since I took office, we've saved employers and West Virginians more than $225 million.

We rank higher than each of our neighboring states in this year's Business Tax Climate Index. Companies are noticing these changes, and they are paying off in big ways in regions across the state.

This September, we joined officials from Procter & Gamble to celebrate the groundbreaking of the company's newest manufacturing plant -- the first of its kind built in the United States since the 1970s.

Projects of this size and scope strengthen our economy, create new jobs and serve as an investment in both our state and our people. This factory -- located in the Eastern Panhandle -- will create 1,000 jobs during the initial construction phase. Once fully operational, it is projected to employ the company's fifth largest workforce in the country.

We've worked hard to bring these jobs to West Virginia for West Virginians, and now, they need filled.

That's why more than a year before production begins, P&G has partnered with BlueRidge Community and Technical College to create specialized training programs to meet workforce needs. These certificate and degree programs are preparing students for careers in engineering, computer science, and electronics and training students to become skilled chemical operator technicians.

BlueRidge President Dr. Peter Checkovich and his team are working hard to make sure our students can compete for these good-paying jobs. P&G construction manager Luis Gutierrez is already working with crews on the ground as part of the company's initial construction efforts. He and his family love calling West Virginia home.

Please join me in thanking Dr. Checkovich for his continued efforts and welcoming Luis and his family to West Virginia.

In 2012, we launched a new workforce training program called Learn and Earn.

This program helps students receive classroom instruction and hands-on experience, while earning a competitive salary, and gives employers a cost-effective way to recruit and train new employees.

We know this program is incredibly successful, and companies like Gestamp -- which manufactures auto parts for some of the world's best known brands -- are taking advantage of these training opportunities.

Since Gestamp first opened in 2013, the South Charleston plant has tripled production and more than doubled its total workforce. Today, Gestamp employs more than 700 West Virginians. These are real jobs, and the company is already seeing a real return-on-investment.

Through a partnership with BridgeValley Community and Technical College, students can get hands-on training and earn a one-year certificate, an associate's degree and a journeyman's card.

With us tonight are Paul Lezanic, Gestamp's new plant manager, and Jamie Thompson, a Learn & Earn graduate who is already training 12 new students. Please join me in welcoming Paul to West Virginia and congratulating Jamie on his success.

These partnerships are essential to helping those investing here train the workforce they need to grow. Tonight, I'm introducing legislation to expand the Learn and Earn program statewide by redirecting nearly $300,000 of the current budget to create new, valuable learning experiences for our students.

We know we must do more to improve our state's workforce participation rate. I'm proud that today there are more job training programs in place than ever before.

With the help of more than $40 million in federal grant funding, Workforce West Virginia is helping coal miners, their families and those who have exhausted their unemployment benefits find careers in growing industries. These programs help employers train workers their way at their worksites and provide up to $5,000 in tuition assistance for classroom instruction and on-the-job training.

As we recognize these efforts to train our workforce, I ask you to remember those who call our state's southern coalfields home.

As a son of these coalfields, I have dedicated my life and my years of public service to supporting our miners and their families. Despite the difficult times we find ourselves in, West Virginia remains the fourth largest producer of electricity in the country, and I believe our coal industry will continue to support our families well into the future.

However, we cannot ignore the unprecedented shift that has taken place in our state and our nation. Forces beyond our control have severely damaged our coal industry, and even the most optimistic among us realize it is unlikely coal will ever reach production levels of the past.

For generations, our miners unearthed the coal used to produce the low-cost energy that fueled this country's Industrial Revolution -- one that remains unmatched anywhere in the world. This nation owes these West Virginians a debt of gratitude and we are ready to cash in on that substantial IOU.

This fall, we submitted an application to the National Disaster Resilience Competition seeking more than $140 million in funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. This competition has the potential to help six counties in our southern coalfields adjust, adapt and advance their communities.

If we're successful, these federal funds will help us rebuild aging infrastructure, promote land use planning and hazard reduction efforts and stimulate housing and economic development in areas outside of the region's floodplains.

We are also proposing to develop the largest industrial site in West Virginia history at the former Hobet surface mine in Boone and Lincoln counties. With 12,000 acres located just off Corridor G, this site is large enough to fit virtually every major economic development project in recent history -- including Toyota, Procter & Gamble, Gestamp, Macy's, Amazon and more -- with thousands of acres left over.

We know this is a major undertaking, and with the help of local landowners Marshall University, West Virginia University and the Virginia Conservation Legacy Fund, we are working together to find new uses for this site while mining activity continues.

Please join me in welcoming this outstanding team: interim Marshall University President Gary White, new Marshall University president Jerry Gilbert, WVU President E. Gordon Gee, and Tom Clarke and Ken McCoy of the Virginia Conservation Legacy Fund.

Tom and his team at VCLF also are helping us develop new and innovative ideas to include in the state's Clean Power Plan submission. While the DEP continues to work on a feasibility study, we anticipate our final plan may include ideas such as reforestation and the replacement of boilers to increase power plant efficiency.

Tom, thank you for your assistance on both of these important projects.

This is just the beginning of what we can do to help diversify the economy of not only this region, but our entire state.

When pursuing large-scale projects, our talented team at the Development Office consistently runs into one major obstacle -- a lack of flat land. Redeveloped surface mine lands offer endless opportunities for residential, commercial and industrial development and in many cases all three.

As part of our federal grant application, we have identified at least five sites in each of Boone, Lincoln, Logan, Mingo, McDowell and Wyoming counties, which are all strong candidates for similar redevelopment efforts.

Much like the country owes West Virginia for our contributions over the years, we -- as West Virginians -- owe the people who call this region home the opportunity to do better for themselves and their families.

For years, taxes on the coal mined from our southern coalfields and the timber taken from our mountain sides have paid for our children's schools, the roads our residents drive on and the services on which so many West Virginians rely.

It's time we reinvest in these communities and give these families every opportunity to make a good living in the places they have called home for generations. Tonight, I hope you will join me in making that commitment for the betterment of our state and our people.

As hardworking West Virginians continue to mine the coal that powers our nation and drill for the natural gas that offers new opportunities for growth, we must guarantee these natural resources meet our needs here at home.

As the ninth largest producer of natural gas in the country, we must work with those operating here to create the processing and pipeline infrastructure necessary to ensure this industry's continued growth.

The ongoing development of the Marcellus and Utica shale -- and the Rogersville formation just being explored -- is already bringing new revenues and new jobs for West Virginians.

That's one reason I sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in support of the Columbia Gas Mountaineer Xpress pipeline project. This $2 billion investment will transport a significant amount of natural gas to new markets.

Much like similar pipeline projects by EQT, Dominion and Momentum Mid-Stream, this investment has the potential to create thousands of good paying construction jobs, while generating significant tax revenues for counties to fund local schools, roads and other worthy endeavors.

While these announcements grab headlines, we can't forget our state's small business owners who work day in and day out to support that same growth in our local communities. Ninety-six percent of West Virginia's employers are small business owners, and they are the backbone of our economy.

While we work to help tens of thousands of West Virginians on unemployment find new opportunities to succeed, we can't overlook the training and skills they already have.

That's why tonight I'm introducing the Self-Employment Assistance Act, a new program to strengthen our local economies, and make it easier for West Virginians receiving unemployment benefits to get the help they need to open a business.

Starting a new business can be hard. No matter how great the idea may be or how hard the owner works to make it a success.

With this exemption, new business owners will be able to reinvest in their company and their employees, while continuing to receive unemployment benefits to support their families.

For 14 years, Matt Dolin worked as a diesel mechanic at a local coal mine just outside of Charleston. When the mine closed, he lost his job. Matt knew he could earn a good income using the skills he already had, but he needed help starting his own business.

Earlier this year, Matt attended a West Virginia Small Business Development Center workshop in Putnam County. He sat down with business coach Bryan Shaw to develop a business plan and find a good location for his new venture.

A few months ago, Matt opened D&D Truck Shop, a full-service diesel truck and heavy equipment repair shop. Not long after he opened, Matt hired his first two employees -- two mechanics who worked alongside him at the coal mine. With the help of the Governor's Guaranteed Workforce Program, Matt is in the process of getting additional support to train new employees.

Although D&D Truck Shop has only been open for a few months, Matt is seeing tremendous growth, and he's already looking to expand.

Matt, Casey and Ronnie, please stand so we may recognize you and congratulate you on the success of your new business.

Helping our residents develop the skills to find a new career is important, but keeping them off drugs is critical to our state's continued growth. Substance abuse has become one of the greatest struggles our state has ever faced, and it is destroying the lives of far too many of our family members, friends and neighbors.

We must continue to make the fight against substance abuse a top priority.

In 2011, I established my Advisory Council on Substance Abuse to help us find more localized ways to combat this epidemic. Since then, we have updated our prescription drug monitoring program, cracked down on the sale of drugs used to make meth and put an end to doctor shopping. We have shut down pill mills for irresponsible prescription practices, and my administration is committed to continuing the fight against drug companies that oversupply pain medication without proper orders.

Last year, we invested significant state funding to expand critical substance abuse treatment and recovery services.

In your seats tonight, you received a brochure that details 150 service providers in every region of the state. This brochure is available online and at local courthouses, hospitals, schools, churches, DHHR offices and libraries in all 55 counties.

This September, we launched 844-HELP4WV, the state's first 24-hour substance abuse help line. This call line gives people the opportunity to speak with certified professionals and receive referral support in their local communities. So far, the call line has connected more than 700 West Virginians with treatment and recovery services across the state.

In October, I welcomed President Obama and DHHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell for an honest discussion about the devastating toll this epidemic is causing West Virginia families and communities.

A few weeks later, I traveled to Martinsburg -- what some consider ground zero of our state's heroin epidemic -- to host my own Substance Abuse Summit. We brought together a panel of West Virginians to share their experiences in the fight against substance abuse, recognize the progress we've made and identify ways we can work together to create a brighter, drug-free future for our residents.

We want people to find help and hope in West Virginia. And that starts with making sure treatment facilities are providing comprehensive care.

Tonight, I'm introducing legislation to establish licensing requirements for medication-assisted treatment facilities. Research shows us that the use of Suboxone and Methadone alone does not support long-term recovery. These medications don't treat the root cause of an addiction, and only continue the addiction cycle.

This legislation requires counseling and behavioral therapies be used in conjunction with these medications to make sure those seeking treatment have the support they need to begin the recovery process.

Last year, I urged this Legislature to expand access to Narcan to help our state's first responders, friends and families of those struggling with addiction reverse the effects of a heroin overdose. Since May, we've coordinated training sessions in regions across the state to teach first responders and others how to administer this drug safely. Today, more than 100 people are certified to host these sessions in their local communities.

In 2015, first responders administered more than 3,000 doses of Narcan -- giving those struggling with an opioid addiction the opportunity to get help.

When an overdose happens, every second counts. And in many cases, fire and EMS crews aren't always first on the scene.

This November, Patrolman Nick Castleman and Patrolman Seth Johnson found themselves first on the scene of a drug overdose on Charleston's West Side. The officers administered two life-saving doses of Narcan, and within minutes, the young man regained consciousness and was transported to the emergency room for treatment.

Patrolman Castleman and Patrolman Johnson are with us tonight. Gentlemen, please stand so we may thank you for the work you do to keep our communities safe.

This man's life was saved because of quick action by these officers, and our efforts to expand access to this life-saving drug.

Tonight, I once again urge this Legislature to expand access to Narcan by supporting my proposal to make it available to any West Virginian -- without a prescription.

This new legislation requires pharmacists to become certified to train those who receive this drug to make sure they can safely administer it if a crisis occurs. It will also help us keep track of who is receiving Narcan to better focus state resources in areas hardest hit by opioid overdoses and be sure it isn't being used as a crutch to enable a heroin addiction.

We know our state's substance abuse epidemic is heartbreaking for so many of our families and communities, but in many cases, our children suffer most.

That's why last year, following recommendations from my Commission on Juvenile Justice and with the help of this Legislature, we launched comprehensive juvenile justice reform. This legislative package provided $600,000 in new funding to establish truancy diversion programs in each county to offer early intervention to those students who need it.

Since launching its own program in 2010, Putnam County has seen significant improvements in overall student attendance and achievement. Truancy referrals have dropped in half and four-year graduation rates have increased from 78 percent to 90 percent during that same period.

We know this program works, and it's making a difference for students like Winter Davis.

For most of her life, Winter didn't have a stable place to call home. From the time she was born, her parents struggled with substance abuse. She spent much of her youth living with a family of no relation, helping to care for their young children and elderly family members.

Between 2011 and 2012, Winter missed 39 days of school. She got behind in her classwork and was struggling to keep up with her classmates. With the help of Putnam County's truancy diversion program, attendance director Jennifer Hodges and Judge Phillip Stowers, Winter got the extra attention she needed and earned her high school diploma, graduating with a 3.7 GPA and zero unexcused absences.

Today, Winter is a certified EMT and plans to become a teacher for children with special needs a dream that she's had since the sixth grade.

Winter shared part of her story with me and said, ""Life was not easy for me, but I am making the best choices I can. I'm the only one in my family that has gone to college and I'm going to finish college no matter what it takes.""

Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Winter Davis, Jennifer Hodges and Judge Stowers.

These reforms have also expanded youth reporting centers to get kids help in their local communities, instead of sending them to group facilities away from their families. By connecting children and families with substance abuse recovery services, mental health programs and functional family therapies, we are giving the whole family the opportunity to thrive.

Thanks to the changes approved by this Legislature, and the work of our local partners across the state, we've reduced the number of kids being sent to out-of-home placements by more than one-third and reduced the number of detention beds by more than 40 percent. So far, we've saved $6 million and the Division of Juvenile Services is confident we can double that savings in the coming years.

By providing our kids with the help they need at home, we're giving them the opportunity to take advantage of the bright future we are creating here in West Virginia.

In 2010, we started down a path to improve our state's public education system.

Instead of allowing paperwork to drive education, we refocused our efforts to provide our children with the skills they need to compete in today's global economy. Since then, we've expanded early childhood education to help our youngest students build a foundation for a lifetime of learning. We're engaging middle school and high school students with hands-on training programs.

We're breaking down bureaucratic silos between state agencies, providing a more seamless transition for students transferring between community and technical colleges and four-year institutions.

These reforms -- and the standards that come with them -- are giving our kids the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, and that starts by making sure our students are in the classroom for 180 days of instructional time.

Over the past year, the delivery of public education in West Virginia has been used as a political football by members of both parties. It's disappointing. It's unacceptable. And it's a disservice to our kids.

At a time when comprehensive reform has led to real improvements, and our students are more competitive with their peers in other states, we need to build on these successes -- not introduce legislation that prioritizes summer vacations over a good education. We cannot allow politics or red tape to get in the way of providing our kids with a thorough and efficient education.

While there are a number of reasons why traditional charter schools are not the best option for our students, we can find common ground by rewarding schools for innovation and creativity while raising student achievement.

That's why I'm introducing legislation to restructure the current innovation zone system to establish a new program -- called Innovation in Education.

This legislation reallocates nearly $2.5 million in existing education funding to help schools develop new methods to increase our students' interest in science, technology, engineering, math and entrepreneurship. By giving schools the flexibility to focus on these subjects, we can teach our students how to think critically -- a skill they need to be successful long after they've graduated high school.

All of us in this chamber tonight and those watching and listening across the state know we are experiencing budget challenges unseen in more than a generation.

Nearly every agency and every branch of state government has shared in the burden of these reductions.

In spite of those challenges, we are paying not only our current bills, but keeping every financial commitment of the past, paying down our debts in workers' compensation, teachers' retirement and public employees' retirement. And we've done that without a single tax increase, while reducing tax burdens on West Virginia families and those doing business here by hundreds of millions of dollars.

Tonight, I am introducing legislation to pay off our old workers' compensation debt more than a decade ahead of schedule.

By accelerating this final payment, we can remove additional severance taxes on our coal and natural gas industries, providing much-needed relief to help them invest in our state and employ West Virginia workers. While historically low energy prices are good news when we fill up at the pump and pay our utility bills, they make it hard on our state budget.

As we work to find new ways to ensure our tax base is both stable and more diverse, we must also seriously consider new revenue opportunities.

Tonight, I am introducing legislation to increase our state's tobacco tax by 45 cents a pack to a total of one dollar. This increase will be considered too high by some people and too low by others. But it strikes a balance that protects retailers in our border counties and discourages our young people from smoking, while generating nearly $71.5 million annually in new revenue.

Combined with savings from a new prescription drug contract, $43 million of this new revenue will fund PEIA, meaning public employees will not see the dramatic benefit reductions initially proposed for the coming year.

I also am proposing legislation to eliminate a sales tax exemption and bring our state's telecommunications tax in line with 41 other states across the country. Once adopted, this legislation will place the same 6 percent sales tax on cell phone and phone line usage -- putting us in step with what is done in the vast majority of other states. By eliminating this exemption, we can collect an extra $60 million each year.

With these proposed changes -- and despite low severance tax projections -- the 2017 budget I present to you tonight uses no money, no money from our Rainy Day Fund and does not include any across-the-board budget cuts beyond those already in place.

In spite of the tight budget years of the past, our new six-year budget forecast shows surpluses of nearly $7 million in 2019, $89 million in 2020 and $118 million in 2021. While I won't be in office to see these surpluses, I'm proud to have been part of more than 30 years of responsible fiscal policies that have put us on the path to a brighter financial future.

As we look ahead at the challenges we must overcome this year, we are reminded that West Virginians have never had it easy. But we have proved time and again, for generations, what has been true all along -- the people who call our state home are among the best and brightest in the world.

Clara Grant Santucci grew up in what was once a one room school house with her five brothers and sisters. This Doddridge County native spent her childhood like so many of West Virginia's children -- playing outside, caring for the family garden and racing her brothers and sisters on her family's gravel road. By high school, she was breaking records and winning state track titles.

Clara was determined to run cross country for Coach Sean Cleary at WVU, and her hard work paid off. As a Mountaineer, she became an All-American.

In 2011, she ran the Boston Marathon. Clara finished 16th overall and was the 3rd American finisher. And three years later, she made her mark on the national stage -- winning the Pittsburgh Marathon with a time of 2 hours, 32 minutes and 25 seconds.

Last summer, Clara returned to the Pittsburgh Marathon. For most of the race, she sat in second place, but after catching sight of the leader, she found the mental toughness to not only win for the second year in a row but to finish 40 seconds ahead of her competition.

This February, Clara will travel to the U.S. Olympic Trials in Los Angeles for a chance to compete for Team U.S.A. in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil.

Katherine Johnson, who was born in White Sulphur Springs in 1918, would become what NASA Administrator Charles Bolden called ""one of the greatest minds ever to grace our agency or our country.""

For 33 years, she worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, what is now known as NASA. She used the most advanced practical mathematics of her day to chart and verify the path John Glenn would travel as he orbited the earth.

In 1958, Katherine's research focused on calculating margins of error for spacecraft take-offs and landings. The 34-page document was the first paper ever published by NASA's Flight Research Division with a woman's name on it.

Throughout her career, Katherine published 26 scientific papers. Her research was used to complete the Mercury and Apollo missions and was critical to sending man into space and bringing him home safely.

For decades, Katherine's story was hidden in the pages of history. This November she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our country's highest civilian honor for her incredible contributions.

In an interview with the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Katherine's daughter Joylette Hylick -- a former NASA scientist herself -- said it was her mother's quiet confidence that drove her to succeed.

Joylette told the Gazette-Mail, ""my granddaddy told my mom she was no better than anybody else, and she was no less than anybody else. And she believed it.""

Please join me as we celebrate the courage of these incredible West Virginians and wish Clara the best of luck in next month's Olympic trials.

Whether a marathon runner, an unemployed miner, a NASA scientist, a single mother going back to school, a budding entrepreneur, the CEO of an international company or a recent graduate overcoming challenges to help her local community, West Virginians have always been willing to work twice as hard and be twice as tough to get the job done.

Over the next 60 days and throughout the coming year, we know there is work to do and difficult choices to make. Tonight, I challenge each of you to find the courage to make these decisions for the sake of the next generation -- not the next election.

It's time to get to work.

Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the great state of West Virginia.",TRUE,Executive Address,02/12/16 11:13 AM
3552,1038184,Governor Scott Walker's 2016 State of the State Address,01/19/16,1,"The state of our state is strong.  We are moving Wisconsin forward.

Think about these simple facts:

There are more people working in Wisconsin than at nearly any other point in our history; state finances are stable; our school students are doing well overall; college tuition is frozen; and property and income taxes are down from 2010.

The Wisconsin Comeback is real.

When I was running for re-election just over a year ago, I said we would ensure everyone who wanted a job could find a job.  So, what kind of progress have we made in the past year?

Well, the most recent unemployment rate in our state is the lowest it has been since March of 2001.  Let's put that into perspective: my son, Alex, is a junior at the University of Wisconsin and my son, Matt, is a senior at Marquette University.  The last time the unemployment rate was this low, they were 5 and 6 years old.

Late last year, we saw the largest monthly jobs gain since April of 1992.  That's nearly 24 years ago, back before Tonette and I even went on our first date.

The percentage of people working in Wisconsin, the Labor Force Participation Rate, is 67.8 percent.  This is 5.3 points better than the national rate and puts us in the top ten states in America.

According to the federal government's current employment statistics and local area unemployment statistics, more people were working in Wisconsin in 2015 than at any time in the past 20 years.

That's right.  While so many in the media seem to obsess with negative stories, these facts from the federal Department of Labor show more people were working during this past year than at any time in the past two decades. 

Last year, initial weekly unemployment claims averaged the lowest level since 1989.  The facts show that fewer people are filing for unemployment and more people are working.

People like Sam Critzer of Madison who was hired as a Certified Nursing Assistant at St. Mary's and Brian Schuster from Lodi who got a job working as an Architectural Designer at Sullivan Design Build.

Not only are more people working, new business formations were up 3.6 percent last year.  The economic impact of tourism increased 5.5 percent.

To continue this kind of growth in jobs and commerce, employers want stability.  That's why we work so hard to get our fiscal house in order.  It also ensures that the government will not be a burden on future generations.

I am proud that Wisconsin finished the fiscal year with a $135.6 million budget surplus.

The state's rainy day fund is the largest in our history--165 times bigger than when we first took office.

Wisconsin is one of only two states with a fully funded pension system.  While our neighbors to the south have a pension that is not even half funded, we are covered.  This fact provides peace of mind to our retirees and gives businesses part of the certainty they need to hire people in Wisconsin.

Our per capita debt--which includes pension and long-term health obligations--is among the lowest.  That means we are one of the top ten best states in the country.

Bonding levels in the current state budget are the lowest in 20 years.

And we continue to weed out waste, fraud, and abuse to make government more effective, more efficient, and more accountable to you--the hard-working taxpayers.

In 2012, I launched the Lean Government Initiative.  Here's one example: this past year, the Department of Safety and Professional Services used lean to save nearly $38,000 annually by switching to electronic documents for some of its panels.  Thankfully, our employees realize that every dollar counts.

To put this in perspective, the money saved from this reform is enough to pay for 43 students to go through a youth apprenticeship.  Tonight, Janie Brischke, a state employee who was the sponsor of that lean project, is here with us.  Thank you, Janie.

Let me repeat, our goal is to ensure that everyone who wants a job can find a job.  One of the best ways to get people the skills they need to succeed is through a great education.  Thankfully, we have some of the best schools in the country here in Wisconsin.

The graduating class of 2015 had the 2nd highest ACT scores in the country.  And thanks to our efforts to prepare all students for college and career, the class of 2016 will be the first to be given the opportunity to take the ACT free of charge; helping overcome financial barriers and close achievement gaps.

In our state, 4th and 8th grade reading scores went up again in 2015.

According to the most recent report, Wisconsin's high school graduation rates are also up again--to third best in the country.  Here with us tonight are students from Kewaunee and Fennimore high schools.  In the most recent report, these two high schools graduated 100 percent of their senior classes.

Let's give a big round of applause to them and to their teachers and parents--and to all the others like them across Wisconsin.  Thank you!

And speaking of students, we helped make college more affordable at our University of Wisconsin campuses as we froze tuition--for the first time ever--four years in a row.  As a parent of two sons in college, I know how important it is to keep costs down for students and for the families who support them.

During the ten years before our freeze, the average annual increase in tuition within the University of Wisconsin System was over 8 percent.  That was a 118 percent increase over a decade.

Compared to the previous trend, our tuition freeze saves the average student more than $6,000 over four years.  That's real money, and it helps make school more affordable to college students and working families.

With us tonight are a few UW students who have benefitted from our tuition freeze.  Please welcome Erin Larson from Greenleaf, Michael Daniels from Appleton, and Sarah McQuade from Hartland.

We're also making it easier to get a great education at any of our excellent technical colleges within the state.  Through our Blueprint for Prosperity initiative, we helped our technical colleges enroll another 5,000 students into high-demand career programs.

And we increased the number of youth apprenticeships and adult apprenticeships over the past four years. Our Youth Apprenticeships have more than doubled and our adult apprenticeships have increased by more than 30 percent.

You see, good-paying careers typically require more than a high school diploma.  We need our young people to have as many excellent higher education options as possible to prepare for the workforce needs of the 21st century.

It also means changing our perspectives.  We must value our students who choose to be highly skilled welders, IT technicians, or certified nursing assistants as much as we do those who choose to be doctors or lawyers.  Each of these professions is vitally needed for a strong economy in Wisconsin.

Tonight, we are joined by Fox Valley Technical College students, Grant Richman from Madison, Sarah Dernlan from Appleton, Monica Stinski from Menasha, Emily Rohde from Neenah, and their instructor, Elizabeth Rath.  They are all finishing their training as CNAs this week.

In addition, we are helping working families, senior citizens, small business owners, and family farmers afford to live, work, play, and retire here in Wisconsin.  Tonight, I am proud to say that property and income taxes are down from where they were when we took office.

We didn't just slow the rate of increase; we actually reduced the tax burden from where it was five years ago.

Tonette and I used to grumble when our property tax bill showed up each December.  In fact, we often let it sit for a few days before we opened it up because we were afraid to see the increase.  Now, it is great to hear the stories of so many people who have a sigh of relief when they open their bills.

Property taxes on a median-valued home in Wisconsin were $116 lower this past year than they were in 2010.  Over the past five years, that homeowner saved $1,227 from where property taxes were headed versus how they've gone down under our reforms collectively between 2010 and 2015.

And it's not just property tax relief--we've cut income taxes, too.  A median income family will see a four-year income tax reduction of $916.  That's real money for hard-working taxpayers all across Wisconsin.

We also helped farmers and manufacturers in our state with a production tax credit that is phased in through this year.  This helps some of our most important industries.

And we helped lower the tax burden on small businesses.  Our reforms help them invest more into their companies and to expand their workforces.

One of the common things I hear from employers all across the state is that they have job openings, but that they cannot find qualified workers to fill these positions.  That's why we've invested millions more into worker training programs.  Still, we need more people in the workforce.  We cannot afford to have anyone on the sidelines.

I am so proud that we helped transfer 8,334 people from government dependence to true independence.  You see, the State of Wisconsin now requires able-bodied adults without children in the home to be enrolled in a job training program before they can get food stamps.  We believe in helping people get the training necessary to find rewarding careers.

That's good for the taxpayers as it reduces the number of people on government programs.  It's good for employers as many are looking for skilled workers.  Best of all, it is good for each and every individual who now is able to find employment and control his or her own destiny.

People like Jessica who enrolled in our program last June.  In August, she got a job in housekeeping at a local hotel.  She now works full-time at a wood flooring mill.  Along the way, she also received help to finish her studies at Northcentral Technical College to be a certified nursing assistant.  She took her final exam for certification on January 8th.  Congratulations, Jessica!

In the spring of 2015, Rebecca joined our program.  Through job classes, she worked on interview skills and made a resume.  Rebecca searched for work and successfully gained employment at Wal-Mart in the deli department.  Rebecca has been employed now for more than five months and is grateful for the experience she received with our program.

Thomas sought our help last June.  Within a month, he got a job.  In December, he was hired by Harley-Davidson as a full-time warehouse employee.

For too long, government programs have entrapped individuals like this into extended dependency.  Our reforms help people get the training they need to get back up on their own feet.

When we first proposed these reforms, some in this Capitol argued that we were making it harder to get government assistance.  The truth is: we're making it easier to find a job.

You see, true freedom and prosperity do not come from the mighty hand of the government.  They come from empowering people to live their own lives through the dignity that comes from work.

When I was a kid, my first job was washing dishes at the Countryside Restaurant.  Later in high school, I flipped hamburgers at McDonald's in my hometown of Delavan.

These jobs taught me the importance of hard work.  Tonette and I made sure our sons worked similar jobs at a pizza place and a custard stand.  Traveling the state, I've heard many people tell me stories of their first jobs.  It is in our nature as humans to want to be productive and contribute to our families and to our communities.

Think about it.  No one signs a high school year book saying, ""good luck becoming dependent on the government.""  Instead, we aspire to be able to support ourselves and our families and to provide a good life for future generations.

That's why our focus in state government is simple: everyone who wants a job can find a job.  Helping people identify a meaningful career is worth far more than a paycheck.  It's really about helping people achieve true independence.  It's about living the American Dream.

In 2016, we want to help more people live that dream here in Wisconsin.

As mentioned, people across this state constantly tell me about job openings in their areas.  To fill these positions, we need to work with students at a younger age to get them ready for the many exciting careers available in our state.

In the fall, 25 school districts will be part of an Academic and Career Plans pilot.  We provided funding, so every child in the state between grades 6 and 12 can have access to a plan beginning in the 2017 school year.  This will prepare students to think about their interests so they can take courses in junior high and high school that will prepare them for their future occupations.

We have some of the best schools in the country, but we need to do more for our students to succeed in the 21st century.  In the past, we enacted major reforms that helped schools reward great teachers, improve curriculum, and balance budgets.

Now, we need to do more to reform state government and put those savings into public education.  One area to consider for real reform is the way we administer health insurance for state employees, which some experts believe could save tens of millions of dollars.

Tonight, I commit to investing every penny of savings to the general fund from these specific reforms to support public education.  People tell me that they appreciate our efforts to get the state's fiscal house in order and that now is the time to use savings to help our students prepare for the future.

Even before the next budget, we want to put more resources into public education.  Tonight, I am pleased to announce we will provide an additional $3 million for dual enrollment programs in our schools through the Wisconsin Fast Forward program.  These grants will help districts to partner with local technical colleges, so our students can get a jump-start on their career plans.

We are also excited to work with the University of Wisconsin System to explore providing a three-year degree that would start in our high schools and continue on many of our UW campuses.  This would help reduce costs and move people into the workforce sooner.

As we mentioned this past week, student loan debt has increasingly become a burden for young professionals.  The best way to tackle this issue is to keep the costs down in the first place.  That is why we worked together to freeze tuition for four years.

Still, there are many young people who took out loans before our freeze or did so at private institutions.  So we have a package of ideas to help offset the price of college and reduce the costs of student loan debt.  We believe that these measures can garner bipartisan support in this legislative session.

Thank you to Representative Dave Murphy, as well as Senator Howard Marklein, Senator Sheila Harsdorf, Representative John Macco, and Representative Dave Heaton, for working with us to put together these plans:

First, we will allow for the full deduction of student loan interest on state income taxes.

Second, we will increase Wisconsin grants for technical colleges to help another 1,000 students, which is on top of the more than 5,000 students we added under our Blueprint for Prosperity.
Third, we'll expand the emergency grants program for students at technical colleges and two-year UW Colleges.

Fourth, we'll increase internships within the UW System to help prepare students for future careers.
Fifth, we look to expand transparency by sending information to students each year about their current and projected student loan debt levels and education costs. 

Tonight, I call on lawmakers in both parties to pass this legislative package as soon as possible to help lower the cost of higher education and to ease the burden of student loan debt.

In addition, I look forward to working with UW System President Ray Cross and Board of Regents President Regina Millner and Vice President John Behling to strengthen and promote programs to allow students to graduate on time, to explore a three-year degree, and to expand the UW Flex Option to a number of students equal to a new UW campus.  We want a quality education to be affordable in Wisconsin for college students and their families.

You see, we now compete in a global economy.  Education will drive success, as will technology.  That is why I am glad that we tripled the amount of funding in our budget dedicated this year for broadband access across the state.

People can do business anywhere in the world, but they need access to high-speed internet connections.  Our program partners with local investments to install a fiber network.  Once completed, a private company provides the service.

Without our assistance, rural areas would be deprived of quality internet access because private companies could not justify the rate of return on investment.  Our program helps small businesses, family farmers, tourism attractions, and public schools across the state.

While these investments are great, investing in our people is even more important.  Today, we are assisting people with disabilities prepare to enter the workforce by helping employers understand their unique abilities.

In 2015, the state Division of Vocational Rehabilitation assisted nearly 5,000 people with disabilities reach their employment goal.  This was the highest rate in 15 years.

We are also helping people with disabilities in high school get ready for careers through something called Project SEARCH.  Here in Wisconsin, the program has a success rate of 85 percent--higher than the national rate.

Last year, we grew Project SEARCH to 16 total employer sites.  Tonight, I am pleased to note that our funding will help add three more employer sites in 2016.

Helping to keep valuable employees in the workforce is also important.  For example, many don't know that the majority of caregivers for people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease are employed beyond their roles as caregivers.

With this in mind, we have a new kit for employers to use to help their valued employees who are caring for a loved one.  Tonight, I invite you to get more information about this at dhs.wisconsin.gov/dementia.

The idea for the kit came from former Wisconsin Governor Marty Schreiber whose wife, Elaine, has Alzheimer's disease.  He worked with my Secretary of Health Services, Kitty Rhoades, on the project.  Governor Schreiber is traveling tonight, but we're grateful to him and to Secretary Rhoades for their hard work on this issue.

Helping people deal with their health care needs--including mental health--is another way to retain top talent in the workplace.  We need to break the stigma and assist people to get the help that they need.  I am proud that we put more resources into mental health services than any Wisconsin Governor in the past 25 years.

In 2013, I pronounced that no man or woman who served our country in the Armed Forces should return home and not be able to find employment.

Here in Wisconsin, I am proud to say that we lowered the unemployment rate for veterans in 2014, and again, in 2015.  Our state now has one of the lowest unemployment rates for veterans in the nation, significantly below the national unemployment rate for veterans.

Our goal is to see it drop again this year.  We owe it to our returning heroes.

All of these different initiatives are designed to increase independence while helping people get the education and skills they need to succeed in the workforce.

As I said at the onset of this address, the state of our state is strong.

There are more people working in Wisconsin than at nearly any other point in our history; state finances are stable; overall, our school students are doing well; college tuition is frozen; and property and income taxes are down from where they were before I took office.

Looking ahead, we have an aggressive plan over the next year to ensure that everyone who wants a job can find a job.  We will enact this plan by helping the people of this state improve the economy and by investing in K-12 education, higher education, and worker training.

Still, we need to do more.  We need to prepare for the future.

As we think about the next 20 years, I want to hear from you about your hopes and dreams--for your families, your communities, and your state.

With this in mind, I am proud to announce that we are going to visit every part of the state to hold listening sessions throughout 2016.  So far, we have held sessions in Seymour, Prairie du Chien, Milwaukee, Osseo, Kewaunee, Sturgeon Bay, and Ashwaubenon and we plan on coming to a community near you soon.

So far, participants have included principals, farmers, small business owners, local government officials, retirees, veterans, teachers, construction workers, union members, parents, high school students, nurses, charitable organization leaders, superintendents, insurance agents, ministers, college students, machinists, law enforcement, and a librarian.

This is personal for me, as I think the best way to plan for the future is to hear from people all over the state.  We need a shared vision for the future.  This is why I want to hear from you.

I call it our 2020 Vision Project.  The idea is to bring together a diverse mix of people in small group settings all across the state.  I want to hear from you about what makes Wisconsin great, where we want our state to be in the next two decades, and how we should measure success.

Now, more than ever, it is important to consider the kind of state our children and grandchildren will inherit.  We need to think more about the next generation than just about the next election.

The founders of our state and our country had that kind of long view of the world.  Their founding principles were able to overcome partisan and political differences.  We can do the same as we think about the kind of state we want to become over the next 20 years and beyond.

On July 4th, we will observe the 240th birthday of this great country--a nation built on the principle of freedom.  As we celebrate, let us remember that our rights are endowed by our Creator, defined by our Constitution, but defended each and every day by the men and women who wear the uniform.

They and their families deserve our praise--and more importantly--our prayers.  May God bless each and every one of them.  May God bless the great State of Wisconsin.  And may God bless the United States of America.",TRUE,Executive Address,02/12/16 11:23 AM
66464,1039356,Gov. Edwards' 2016 Special Session Opening Address,02/14/16,6,"Speaker Barras, President Alario, Members of the Legislature, Family and Friends, My Fellow Louisianans:

I stand before you today aware of the magnitude of the challenge that has brought us together. Today, we face the largest budget deficit in our state's history. Our work will not be easy, but I am optimistic that our love of this state and our responsibility to our citizens will anchor our actions.

The last time I stood here, I said that I hoped, and expected, to be back in this chamber so that we could work together to fix our state's problems in a lasting and bipartisan way -- a way that is worthy of the people of Louisiana.

Well, here we are -- together in this chamber with a common mission and critical purpose.

We have a $940 million budget deficit that must be corrected by June 30th. And next year, we are facing a $2 billion budget deficit.

It's time for fiscal responsibility in this state. No more smoke and no more mirrors.

I am asking everyone to shed partisan labels and blinders and work with me to repair the state we all love. I will do the same.

I did not call you here to continue putting off the tough decisions. We've done that for eight years. I have called you here because our present budget crisis requires that we take immediate and decisive action.

As I see it - how you respond to this call will determine the course of Louisiana's future.

As I said the last time I stood here, real leadership is required. Leadership that will be present, not absent, leadership that will be involved, not detached.

And I promise you this -- I will roll up my sleeves to work with you --not from another state and not while pursuing any other position.

I urge you to remember that behind every budget number are real Louisiana citizens, families, students, and kids like Braden Wilson, who I talked about Thursday night.

Braden suffers from Leigh's Disease and has been bedridden since birth. Braden's mom, Kodi, is with us today. Kodi, please stand up. I talk about Braden because his family is one of thousands at risk for losing the NOW waiver they rely on to help pay for care.

The people of this state are demanding us to do what is right.

Now, I am mindful as I address this chamber that we will not agree on every solution. There are some that will tell you we have a spending problem. That simply ""tightening our belts"" will eliminate this historic deficit, but let me be clear -- we can't just cut our way out of this crisis.

It simply isn't possible to always do more with less, otherwise, one day, you could do everything with nothing. The world just doesn't work that way.

Here are the facts:

While my predecessor inherited a $1 billion dollar surplus when he became Governor, I've been left with almost a $1 billion deficit that we must resolve in the next 4 months and a $2 billion deficit next fiscal year. Again, the largest budget deficit in the history of our state.

We are $570 million short of the revenue we expected to bring in this year, due in part, to the drop in oil prices and a slowdown in sales and corporate tax collections. In fact, we're paying out more in credits and refunds to corporations this year than we are collecting from them in taxes. For example, the amount of the industrial tax exemption is now greater than the homestead exemption we give to families in Louisiana. We've lost our way. We've got to return to a sensible, balanced approach.

Additionally, we have $370 million in commitments we made that we don't have the money to pay for. The current budget failed to account for how many people would need access to public health care, how many students would qualify for TOPS, how many people would enroll in our public schools, and how many state inmates would be housed by our sheriffs, among other failures.

As you know, we've had budget deficits in Louisiana for eight straight years, and rather than make the structural changes we needed, instead one-time funds were increasingly used to patch budget shortfalls. Today, all of that money is gone. Make believe efficiencies, more and more tax giveaways, and privatization schemes that actually increased costs all further exacerbated the problem. Blunders of the past have led us to this day of reckoning. Now is the time to make the more difficult right decisions instead of the easier wrong ones that appease an out-of-state special interest or serve a political agenda.

To do this, we need a balanced approach of strategic cuts and new revenue. Focusing on one without the other would be irresponsible, especially when the problem is so massive.

I want to stress to you how important it is that every moment of this three week session be spent fixing this historic crisis. That small window of time is all we've got to get it right. If left unresolved, we will face unimaginable cuts to vital state services.

Before I outline what's at stake, I want to quiet those critics who say I am not proposing spending cuts. The plan I am presenting to you includes at least $160 million in painful cuts. I have met my constitutional obligation with regard to cuts with an executive order signed earlier today, and I have further asked the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget to make additional reductions. Now it's your turn. You have the ability to approve an additional roughly $30 million in cuts that I have proposed. And you should be mindful that, whatever supplemental appropriations we have, but we can't afford, will be cut as well.

In fact, more than half of my proposal to fill our current fiscal year deficit does not require raising additional revenue. So, I ask you, when someone comes to you and says we can cut our way out of this crisis -- that we have a spending problem and not a revenue problem -- that there are painless options that solve the problem and they point to studies that are 15 and 20 years old -- you should demand specifics because here is what is at stake.

HEALTHCARE
The Department of Health and Hospitals is already facing severe cuts because of how massive the budget problems have become. However, without generating more revenue, those cuts will be catastrophic.
Safety net hospitals across the state will close -- leaving communities without health care options, not just for the poor, but for everyone.

Vital health care services would be gone. While there are services we are constitutionally required to offer, the ""optional"" services at risk of being cut are really not optional to the many children, elderly, and disabled citizens who depend on them to survive.

The New Opportunity Waiver program, which provides much-needed help for families with developmental disabilities like Kodi Wilson's is also under consideration for painful cuts and could be offered to far fewer people.

Funding for services such as hospice care and end-stage kidney dialysis would also be impacted.
When it comes to life and death issues -- our discussion should be clear. We should fight like hell to protect those services for our citizens.

On the positive side, we will lower our health care costs by expanding the Medicaid program so working families can have access to health care.

Folks like Butch and Dawn Schouest (pronounced Sh-west), from Cypremort Point are also here with us today. Butch and his family have made a living as professional shrimpers for generations. After the BP oil spill devastated their business, they could no longer afford their health insurance.

However, when they applied for Medicaid, they were told they didn't qualify because Louisiana rejected the Medicaid Expansion which would have covered citizens like him. Butch and Dawn aren't asking for a hand out. They're asking for one of life's most basic necessities -- decent health care -- health care that our federal tax dollars are already paying for.

This is an opportunity to dramatically improve the health of our working poor, while saving tax dollars, creating jobs, and investing in our workforce. Today, we pay 38 percent of the cost of providing care to the uninsured after they already are sick, but with expansion, we will never have to pay for more than 10 percent of the cost of helping the same patients see their primary care doctor and get preventive care. It is a win-win for health care and the budget.

That said -- the cost of doing nothing is too high. Payments we receive from the federal government to cover the costs that hospitals incur for providing health care services to the uninsured will soon dry up. Those DSH dollars have to be replaced with 100 percent State General Fund. Without these payments -- hospitals will begin closing. Alabama and Georgia are two states already seeing this in rural areas.

EDUCATION
Just as importantly, higher education is at risk for devastating cuts.

Because the Revenue Estimating Conference identified an even greater deficit just last week, higher education will need to cut $42 million, which, in itself, is an historic cut to make this late in the fiscal year. On top of that, the TOPS scholarship fund is operating with a $28 million shortfall. A cost that is being absorbed by our already cash-strapped universities.

However, without additional revenue, higher education will be crushed with more than $200 million in cuts over the next 4 months. And that comes on the heels of the largest disinvestment in higher education in the nation over the last eight years.

If these cuts are allowed to proceed, universities and community and technical colleges will not be able to make payroll. Universities have informed me that campuses will begin closing as soon as May 1st and their accreditation will be threatened.

If you have any doubt about the impact of higher education research facilities, look no further than the LSU physicists who just grabbed international headlines at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, in Livingston Parish. LSU researchers at LIGO recorded, for the first time ever, the sound of two black holes colliding a billion light years away -- demonstrating Einstein's theory of relativity and proving black holes exist. I'm honored to say that the head of the LIGO observatory, LSU Physics Professor Joe Giaime (gee-YAH-mee), and LSU physics professor Gabriela Gonzalez, who leads the 15-nation LIGO Science Collaboration, are here with us today and seated in the balcony. Please stand and be recognized.

But what does this mean for our students? If our institutions are forced to close their doors, students will not be able to complete their courses for the semester, leaving them with a grade of incomplete.
This is what the leaders of our higher education institutions are telling me will happen if we do not act, and I refuse to fail our children in that way.

While students won't be billed for the shortage of TOPS funds this semester, the future of TOPS, a program that I will fight tooth and nail to protect, is at risk, and therefore, so is the future for our children.

So is the dream of students like Kyle Ypya (Yip-yah) whose family we welcome here this afternoon. Kyle, please stand up. Kyle is a high school senior at C.E. Byrd in Shreveport with boundless dreams and an incredible work ethic. Between playing football and maintaining a 4.5 GPA, Kyle eagerly awaits his freshman year at Louisiana Tech next fall to study chemical engineering. The last thing on his mind should be why the tuition award he worked so hard for might slip away because we can't summon the courage to fix the problem.

It is unacceptable that parents like Kyle's who have encouraged their kids to work hard and achieve their goals, to be suddenly struck with the paralyzing fear of figuring out how to replace a scholarship and pay for tuition for their child.

We need to honor Kyle's hard work with hard work of our own.

So, I have put forth a plan that stabilizes our budget, and protects people like Kyle, and Braden Wilson, and the Schouest family. This plan doesn't penalize one group or another, but simply asks us all to share in this sacrifice of stabilizing our budget, so that all of us can share in the prosperity, too, that will follow.

BUDGET PLAN
As I mentioned before, my plan includes significant spending cuts to the tune of more than $160 million, in addition to a hiring freeze across state government and a reduction in state contracts.

I also propose to use $128 million from the rainy day fund and $200 million in non-coastal BP payments to the state to reduce the current year deficit.

My proposals include further reducing tax credits, suspending corporate tax deductions, and adding one penny of sales tax to our state's four cent sales tax. I am proposing this penny as a bridge that will give us time to stabilize and restructure our state's tax code. When that restructuring is complete, this penny sales tax will be removed.

As a part of this restructuring, I am also proposing an increase in alcohol and cigarette taxes.

I've heard the critics say I've changed my tune on raising taxes. My response is this -- in a crisis when the facts change as dramatically as the facts surrounding our budget have, so must the solutions change. That is called responsible leadership. Remember, no one knew we had a budget deficit at all until November 16, 2015 -- five days before I was elected. Since then, the number has grown from $487 million to a staggering $940 million today. Further, the $487 million was supposedly fixed in November through some ""comprehensive solutions,"" as my predecessor said, but wasn't.

Yesterday, Commissioner Jay Dardenne presented an honest and balanced budget for next year, with only the revenue recognized by the Revenue Estimating Conference on Wednesday. It shows that the state is $2 billion short in State General Funds needed to simply provide the same level of basic and essential services. I want to reiterate -- this is not the budget I want to sign into law, and this is not the budget that honors our most sacred obligations to the people of Louisiana. Now is the time -- the only time -- to fix it.
This is not the challenge I imagined I would face one month after becoming your governor, but this is the crisis before us and we must solve it.

As President Eisenhower, another West Point grad, said, ""In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.""

So, if you insist on saying that I never said I would raise taxes -- that I'm going back on my word -- that's fine. Say it. Get it out of your system, and then please come back here ready to work with me to do the job we were all hired to do.

Now, I know there are different opinions on how to achieve these goals. That's why I intentionally made a broad call for this special session. If you want to cut spending further than I have proposed, show me where and who is impacted. That is the first thing in the call. If you believe, as I do, that we should reduce contracts, that, too, is in the call. If you believe as I do that we should reduce statutory dedications, it's in the call. I don't claim to have the market cornered on good ideas to fix this budget, so please bring forth constructive ideas, not simple talking points.

I have gone above and beyond to make this an inclusive process. Let's keep these conversations going. Don't simply back into your corners and dig in your heels. That is the best way to ensure dysfunction and failure.

But just imagine the possibilities if we can walk away from this special session dispelling the notion that we are becoming just like Washington, DC.

Let's write a new headline -- that we were able to work together to solve the greatest budget challenge ever.
Let's ignore the self-serving voices of candidates running for office, after all, that's what got us in this mess. Instead, let's amplify the voices of the solution-driven leaders here who have the courage to actually solve problems before us.

As Louisianans, we've weathered many storms together. This one will be no exception. As I said Thursday night, our best days are ahead.

And just as we open this session in prayer, I am asking that all of us pray daily for our state and our leaders -- for you and for me.

God bless us all as we begin this critical work. God bless the great State of Louisiana, and God bless the United States of America.

Thank you.",TRUE,Executive Address,02/18/16 11:03 AM
77203,1042672,Governor Wolf's 2016-2017 Budget Address,02/09/16,1,"TRANSCRIPT:

I. A Commonwealth in crisis

Lieutenant Governor Stack, Speaker Turzai, President Scarnati. . .

Leader Corman, Leader Costa, Leader Reed, Leader Dermody, members of the General Assembly

Members of the judiciary, members of the cabinet, the auditor general, the attorney general, the treasurer, and my wife, Frances

Most importantly, my fellow Pennsylvanians:

This will not be an ordinary Governor's budget address.

Usually, this speech is an opportunity to lay out an ambitious agenda for the year ahead.

Under ordinary circumstances, I would outline my 2016-17 budget proposal, a proposal full of ideas to move our Commonwealth forward.

I would talk about new measures I'm proposing to ensure that every child in Pennsylvania has a world-class education that starts before kindergarten and goes all the way through college.

I would talk about the new partnerships we can create between the public and private sectors to help create jobs and grow our economy.

I would talk about new innovations that can build on the progress we've already made in modernizing our state government so that it costs less and works better.

And I would talk about some long-overdue steps we can take to help our Commonwealth fulfill the promise of equal opportunity and economic security for all: including protections for the LGBT community in housing and the workplace, the legalization of medical marijuana, a raise in the minimum wage, and criminal justice reform that will bring fairness back to our system and save tax dollars.

But I can't give that speech. Not under these circumstances.

My fellow Pennsylvanians: Our Commonwealth is in crisis. A crisis that threatens our future.

And today, I want to be clear -- with each member of the General Assembly, and with every Pennsylvanian -- about the actions we must take to resolve this crisis, and the consequences we will all face if we don't.

II. This is about math

First, let's be very clear about the nature of the problem.

The problem is not that Republicans in the General Assembly and I don't see eye-to-eye.
After all, Pennsylvanians are used to seeing political leaders disagree, even strongly. And in the 2014 election, they chose divided government: a Democratic Governor, a Republican legislature. I doubt anyone was surprised when it turned out that we had different priorities.

No, this crisis is not about politics at all.

This is about math.

Pennsylvania now faces a $2 billion budget deficit.

That's not a Democratic fact or a Republican fact. It's just a fact.

It's a fact supported by Standard and Poor's -- an independent rating agency. They have done the math. And they agree: Pennsylvania faces a massive structural deficit that will only continue to grow if we fail to address it responsibly.

This deficit isn't just a cloud hanging over Pennsylvania's long-term future. It is a time bomb, ticking away, right now, even as I speak.

If it explodes -- if the people in this chamber allow it to explode -- then Pennsylvania will experience a fiscal catastrophe the likes of which we have never seen.

Please understand: We are not talking about a long-term budget projection. We are talking about Pennsylvania failing to meet its basic obligations -- this year. We are talking about pain that will be felt across our Commonwealth. This year.

If the General Assembly does not approve a responsible plan to solve this crisis, every Pennsylvanian will suffer the consequences. Those consequences will be real. They will be immediate. They will be severe.

Nearly three-quarters of Pennsylvania homeowners will see their already-too-high property taxes skyrocket even further.

If a member of this body were to stand up and propose a massive property tax increase, he or she would be booed off the floor by Democrats and Republicans alike.

But in fact, that is exactly what will happen if we do not act.

We have seen this play out over the last four years. Since 2011, school districts have been forced to increase local property taxes by $1.2 billion, and all because of Harrisburg's irresponsibility.

In the last year alone, 83 school districts increased property taxes above the index because Harrisburg didn't produce a responsible budget, and another 175 school districts are contemplating additional tax increases this year -- for the same reason.

This tax shifting is not sustainable, and it will only continue to squeeze families and seniors if we do not stop passing the buck on to local communities.

Meanwhile, even as Pennsylvanians will pay more, they will get less from their state government. Far less.

For example: Our education system, already threadbare after years of underfunding at the state level, will take a ruinous hit.

· Thousands of teachers will be laid off. Guidance and career counselors will be handed pink slips, as well. In all, more than 23,000 education professionals will be immediately yanked out of Pennsylvania schools.

· Across Pennsylvania, already-crowded classrooms will become even more so. Class sizes will balloon by 30 percent to account for all those teacher layoffs. Worse, the consequences will not be evenly distributed -- classroom crowding will be more severe in the schools that can least afford it. But all across our Commonwealth, our children will receive less attention, less instructional time, less opportunity to gain the skills we need them to have in the 21st century.

· Technical education programs will be cut. Special education programs will be cut. Head Start programs will be cut.

· And tens of thousands of Pennsylvania children will lose access to pre-kindergarten, depriving them of early childhood education that we know is key to their future success.

This is not a threat. This is not political posturing. This is simply what the math tells us will happen if this crisis is not resolved. This is the reality that teachers, and parents, and children in our Commonwealth will face if the General Assembly does not act.

And the damage will not be limited to our schools. Basic state services will also face devastating cuts.

· We will lose nearly $200 million in services to Pennsylvania seniors including prescription drug assistance and home and community based services. Pennsylvania seniors who depend on that assistance will be forced to pay more out of pocket. Some will have to choose between paying for groceries and paying for the medicine that keeps them alive. These are our elderly parents and neighbors, and they are counting on this funding to pay for the medicine they need. But if we don't have a budget, we can't help.

· We will lose $180 million in assistance for people living with mental illness or intellectual disabilities. These Pennsylvanians are the most vulnerable among us, and they are counting on our help to live a full life and contribute to their communities. But if we don't have a budget, they will be denied significant opportunities to improve their lives.

· We will lose $40 million in state funding for child care, and thus forfeit nearly $50 million in federal matching funds, for a total cut of nearly $90 million. Hundreds of thousands of working parents are counting on our help to have some peace of mind and the ability to earn the living upon which they raise their families. But if we don't have a budget, 211,000 Pennsylvania children will have nowhere to go.

· We will lose $11.5 million in funding for domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers. Survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault rely on these safe havens to have somewhere to go in the midst of unthinkable pain and unspeakable terror. But if we don't have a budget, those shelters and crisis centers will have to shut their doors to the people who need them.

Critical programs such as these make up nearly three-quarters of our human services budget.

Simply put: the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cannot meet its obligations to its citizens if the General Assembly does not meet its obligation to pass a responsible budget.

And while my Administration will always strive to tackle fraud and be as efficient as possible, even these harsh new cuts -- cuts that will harm single mothers, seniors on fixed incomes, and those who are down on their luck -- will not solve our crisis.

Indeed, anyone in this Chamber who claims we can simply cut our way out of this mess without also increasing revenue is just ignoring the math. They're also ignoring history. If we don't have sustainable revenue sources in our budget, the result will be billions of dollars in new property tax hikes.

Pennsylvanians need to prepare for these consequences. And I do not say this with any joy whatsoever.

But someone in Harrisburg has to start telling the people of Pennsylvania the truth about the mess we're in.

III. What hasn't worked

Before I ran for Governor, I ran a business. And in challenging times, I know that you can be fiscally responsible while still looking out for the people you serve. These values are not mutually exclusive; they are closely linked.

And if you're in business, and the numbers don't add up, you can't ignore the problem, or spin it, or wish it away.

You have to take a clear-eyed look at how the problem arose, and then you have to solve it. And fast. Or you won't be in business very long.

Pennsylvania businesses don't have the luxury of pretending their problems don't exist. Neither do Pennsylvania families sitting around the kitchen table trying to make ends meet.

And the truth is, neither do we here in Harrisburg.

So let's be honest about where we are and how we got here. After all, this fiscal crisis didn't appear from out of nowhere. This was no act of God. We are in a hole we dug ourselves, right here in Harrisburg. And if the consequences I'm describing sound familiar, it's because Pennsylvania has been building up to this moment for years.

For years, our leaders tried to balance our state budget on the backs of our children and our schools. When I took office, Pennsylvania ranked near the bottom of the country in the percentage of state-level K-12 investment. The burden of funding our schools fell on our local communities. And that, in turn, meant huge spikes in property taxes for Pennsylvania homeowners.

That's a bad way to solve a budget problem. But it's a great way to create an education problem.

We were left with tens of thousands of teachers laid off and crowded classrooms across most of our school districts.

And that was just part of the problem. You see, even these huge cuts to education weren't enough to balance the budget. But instead of finding a sustainable way to deal with our deficit, Harrisburg chose to paper over the problem with a series of budgetary gimmicks and quick fixes.

Maybe you can get away with that for a little while. But sooner or later, the rent is due.
And if folks here in Harrisburg thought this sleight of hand was a real solution to our budget problem, then the only people they were fooling were themselves. Because nobody else bought it.

The three major ratings agencies -- Fitch, Moody's, and Standard and Poor's -- have each downgraded our credit, a total of five times over the last five years. Our credit has actually been downgraded three times in the last two years alone.

And each time, the ratings agencies have explained that the downgrades are a direct result of these little tricks Pennsylvania has employed to avoid facing up to the reality of its fiscal situation.

When Harrisburg doesn't take our budget problem seriously, the folks who rate our credit stop taking Harrisburg seriously.

Today, because of years of budgetary irresponsibility, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is considered to be among the least creditworthy states in America. This is embarrassing. But embarrassment isn't the point.

You see, because our credit has been downgraded so much, we are forced to pay a higher rate of interest on our $17 billion in debt. That will eventually cost us an extra $139 million a year.

That's $139 million that doesn't go to improving our schools, or making our business environment more competitive, or lowering our taxes. It's a $139 million penalty that the people of Pennsylvania pay for Harrisburg's fiscal irresponsibility.

IV. We had a deal

That's how we got here. And it's why, when I took office last year, I proposed a different kind of budget.

Instead of shortchanging our schools, I proposed a historic commitment to education -- beginning to restore the $1 billion that had been cut from our schools under the previous administration, making new investments in early childhood education and community colleges, increasing our state's share of funding for public schools, and directing more of that funding to districts that needed it the most.

And instead of using sleight of hand to avoid dealing with our deficit, I proposed a serious plan to balance our budget and set us on a more sustainable course.

No more gimmicks. No more quick fixes. A new approach in Harrisburg. A fresh start for Pennsylvania.

Now, I expected that Republicans wouldn't agree with everything in my proposed budget.

What I didn't expect was what I got: a budget that didn't even balance.

Incredibly, the budget they sent me relied on the same gimmicks and quick fixes that had gotten us in trouble in the first place -- $1.5 billion worth of optical illusions that would have made our actual budget problem even worse.

If you were running a business, and you took a budget like this to your banker, you would be laughed out of the room. But Pennsylvania's creditors don't have a sense of humor about this sort of thing. And neither should we.

While I was disappointed by the Republicans' proposal, I wasn't discouraged.
So I came to the table ready to talk. Ready to negotiate. Ready to compromise.
It took months of bargaining. It took some painful sacrifices from both sides. But in the end, all that hard work paid off. We had a deal.

The compromise budget I worked out with members of this legislature last year included some of what I wanted -- including a historic investment in our schools -- but not everything. It included some of what Republicans wanted -- including historic changes to our pension and liquor systems -- but not everything.

And I continue to believe we should solve these decades old problems.

We still need changes that provide taxpayers savings and stability in our pension plans, and we need to bring our liquor system into the 21st century.

However, these improvements by themselves are not magic bullets, and changes in these two programs will not alone mitigate the consequences of a continued failure to acknowledge the basic math problem we face.

Again, the compromise budget included these Republican priorities. But most important of all, the compromise budget was balanced. It solved the financial problem. Passing it into law would defuse the fiscal time bomb and set us on a more sustainable course.

It passed the Senate with a majority of both Democrats and Republicans, and had bipartisan support in the House.

All that remained was a final vote before I could sign it into law and we could finally move forward.

I was ready, pen in hand.

And then House Republican leaders justwalked away.

They walked away from the table and went home for the holidays without holding that final vote. They still have not held that final vote. And because of that, we still don't have a budget.

But we still have a budget crisis. That fiscal time bomb is still ticking.

Our teachers hear it. Our parents hear it. Our seniors hear it. Our creditors certainly hear it.

Do you?

But the time for games is over. And now it's time to finish the job we should have finished last year.

V. We can't keep digging

Now, look. Arguments over policy priorities are healthy. Democracy entails disagreement. Compromise is hard.

But we had those arguments. We worked out our disagreements. We reached a compromise. Republicans and Democrats sitting in this chamber right now sat at a table with me and did the hard work to find common ground.

We had a deal. And then the House Republican leaders walked away.
Only in Harrisburg could that be seen as an acceptable way to do business.

But you know what? I'm not interested in the inner workings of the Republican caucus. I'm not interested in the politics of any of this.

This isn't about politics.

Once again, this is about math.

And so here's what's really frustrating: When some Republican leaders bailed on our agreement, I was handed yet another budget where the numbers didn't add up -- a budget that would cut another $95 million from our schools, a budget that would zero out funding increases for our institutions of higher education, and, worst of all, a budget that still didn't balance.

We are sitting at the bottom of a $2 billion hole. It is simply unbelievable that some folks in this chamber want to keep digging.

I can accept that we disagree about the importance of education. I can accept that we disagree about the proper role of government in securing a more prosperous future for our Commonwealth. And I can accept that I won't get my way on everything.

But I can't accept -- Pennsylvania can't afford -- another irresponsible budget that ignores the fact of this fiscal crisis and pretends our problems don't exist.

I didn't run for this office to be party to the corner-cutting and budget gimmickry that got us into this mess. We can't afford to play political games while this crisis is casting a dark shadow on our future. There is simply too much at stake.

The train has been careening down the tracks for years. Now the moment of impact has arrived. And whether or not we crash is up to the people in this chamber.

It's up to the people in this chamber to save our children, our seniors, our most vulnerable populations from bearing the brunt of devastating cuts.

It's up to the people in this chamber to save our taxpayers from getting handed the bills Harrisburg wasn't responsible enough to pay.

It's up to the people in this chamber to save Pennsylvania's future.

It's time for the people in this chamber to get back to work.

VI. The path forward

The good news is that I still have my pen. And we still have a budget that reflects months of hard work and honest negotiation, a budget that has been approved by bipartisan majorities in both chambers of our legislature, a budget that averts this fiscal catastrophe and gives us a chance at a fresh start.

We can get it done. Send that compromise budget to my desk, and we can put our Commonwealth on more secure footing than it has been in years.

But let me be very, very clear with each of you in this chamber: We are going to have to stop playing games with our fiscal future. We are going to have to stop closing our eyes and hoping our problems go away. We are going to have to face facts.

So do not send me another budget full of gimmicks that are too cute by half. Do not send me another budget where the numbers simply don't add up.

I will not be amused. I will not be fooled. I will not be convinced that dime-store magic tricks are a substitute for a real, responsible budget.

And, more importantly, neither will our creditors. Nor the people of Pennsylvania.

If you can't agree to the budget reforms I've proposed, then help me find a sustainable alternative.

But if you won't face up to the reality of the situation we're in. . . if you ignore that time bomb ticking. . . if you won't take seriously your responsibility to the people of Pennsylvania -- then find another job.

Because this is not the time for denial, this is not the time for obstruction. This is the time for leaders to come together and honestly, and sincerely, take on the crisis we are facing.

Because if we do not solve this crisis, whatever partisan gain you think you may win will be dwarfed by the enormous losses our state will suffer. Nobody in Pennsylvania will care one iota about the politics of a disaster that costs our Commonwealth so much.

I refuse to let that happen. But I cannot stop this catastrophe alone. The people of Pennsylvania need you to do the right thing.

VII. Conclusion

I am not asking people in this chamber to give up their political beliefs. I am asking that they join me in mustering the political courage to meet this crisis head-on.

I am asking that they do their job -- and live up to their promise to uphold the constitution made when they were elected to serve in the General Assembly.

This doesn't require anyone to walk away from his or her principles. It merely requires that we each declare that our highest principle is the responsibility each of us has to the people of Pennsylvania.

The people of Pennsylvania deserve schools that teach, jobs that pay, and a government that works for them.

They deserve leaders who are willing to work hard and sacrifice to build a better Commonwealth -- because that's what the people of Pennsylvania do every day to build a better life for their families.

Their strength, their resilience, their spirit illuminates our path forward, and gives me hope that when I stand in this chamber to give my budget address next year, it will be under happier circumstances.

After all, I ran for this office because I believed deeply in our Commonwealth; in our spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship; in our longstanding tradition of tackling our challenges and seizing our opportunities with boldness and courage; integrity and honesty; in our potential to build a future as bright and prosperous as our past.

I know that many of you entered public service for the same reasons. And last December, a number of Republicans and Democrats came together to prove that there are leaders in this body who can put their differences aside and get things done.

After a year as Governor, despite the overwhelming challenge we now face, I still believe in Pennsylvania. The possibilities before us are still limitless. A bright future is still within our grasp.

I still believe in the enormous potential of our Commonwealth.

And I'm counting on everyone in this chamber to do the right thing so we can fulfill that potential.

I'm ready to do the hard work to build a brighter future for Pennsylvania. I hope you're ready to join me.

Thank you and God Bless the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",TRUE,Executive Address,02/29/16 03:00 PM
5276,1044122,Governor Peter Shumlin's 2016 Budget Address,01/21/16,1,"Mr. President, Mr. President Pro Tem, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the General Assembly, distinguished guests, and fellow Vermonters, thank you so much.

My top priority as your Governor has been to make the lives of Vermonters more secure. Our state budget is the roadmap for how we get there.
 
In my first budget speech, coming on the heels of three consecutive budget shortfalls, I pledged to match our spending with Vermonters' ability to pay, and I said let's keep ""with the long tradition of frugality and common sense that is the lifeblood of Vermonters.""
 
 
We have done that. This will be my sixth budget that does not increase income, sales, or rooms and meals tax rates that are already too high.
 
Today, I am proud to present to you a budget that:

    Closes a 68-million-dollar budget gap.
    Does not rely on one-time money for on-going state expenses for the first time since the Great Recession;
    Increases General Fund spending by a modest 3.1 percent, which is matched by an identical projected increase in revenues.
    Protects our most vulnerable Vermonters and helps working families get ahead;
    And helps fund the health care expansion that has given coverage to nearly 20,000 Vermonters who were living in fear that they were one sickness away from bankruptcy just a few years ago.

****
 
While it is easy to criticize a budget, and I know many will, it's difficult to make the tough choices involved in crafting a responsible one.
Let's remember where we started. Five years ago, our state was staggering from the blows of the Great Recession, revenues were in free-fall, and there were no easy choices. Vermont's General Fund revenues had fallen by nearly 15 percent, and we were faced with a 176-million-dollar budget gap.
 
We didn't take the easy way out. We proposed 83 million dollars in General Fund budget reductions and discontinued the prior Administration's phantom savings of 23 million dollars from the failed Challenges for Change program that had been booked but never realized.
 
Despite what you may hear from those who practice revisionist history, five years later our fiscal responsibility has paid off. The state's revenues have grown every year, employers continue to add jobs, our unemployment rate remains low, and personal income growth outpaces the national average. We've done all this while:

    Fully funding pension payments;
    Refusing to raid our rainy day funds;
    Meeting our debt service;
    And honoring our statutory obligation to the Education Fund because Vermonters can't
    shoulder additional property tax increases.

 
****
 
The single biggest challenge to affordability for Vermonters and our job creators is the
unsustainable rising cost of health care. It's also the single biggest challenge we have to maintaining
a sustainable state budget. In fact, this year alone, expanded health costs are driving nearly 75
percent of our budget gap.
 
The math is simple -- Vermont embraced Obamacare and signed up nearly 20,000 Vermonters for
health care, helping us to achieve near universal coverage -- long a goal of mine and many of you.
Today, over 200,000 of our residents are on some form of Medicaid. But while we're eager to
expand Medicaid to families that had been making horrid choices without it, we have refused to
summon the courage to pay for it.
 
Last year I stood here before you as a Governor who has an aversion to taxes, and proposed a
modest payroll tax to pay for the promises we have made. Had that proposal become law, this
year's budget discussion would be very different. The 55-million-dollar shortfall we face in
Medicaid would be virtually non-existent. We would have collected 100 million dollars in federal
money, which we're currently leaving in Washington, that could have been used to adequately
compensate our health care providers who are being driven out of business by a system that pays
them just 40 to 60 cents on the dollar.
 
If you don't believe me, talk to the folks in Franklin County who just lost four family docs because
of inadequate and unfair reimbursement rates. Vermont should not be the state that signs people up
for Medicaid just to turn our backs on them. Vermont should not be the state who begs our doctors
and nurses to take care of folks on Medicaid just to turn their backs on them. That's not leadership
and it's not good government.
 
In order to help plug this year's Medicaid budget hole, I am proposing that the provider assessment
now applied to hospitals and nursing homes be expanded to physicians and dentists, at half of the
rate that other providers are currently paying. This will raise 17 million dollars in state funds and
draw down 20 million of the federal dollars that we've been leaving on the table.
 
These funds will be used to increase Medicaid primary care and dental reimbursements for
providers and hardworking family docs who are currently struggling. Specifically, we will restore
the ill-conceived cuts made by the Affordable Care Act, which make it more difficult for our small,
rural providers to treat those on Medicaid.
 
Rising health care costs don't just threaten our state budget; they continue to create challenges for
Vermont families and businesses. In the last ten years, health care costs have doubled. Without
systematic change, premiums could nearly double in the next decade. If you're worried about
affordability, and as Governor I've been worried about affordability every single day, then rising
health care costs are public enemy number one.
 
That is why since Day One of my Administration we have been working to change the way we pay for healthcare by moving from a fee for service payment method to an outcomes-based approach, or what is known as the All-Payer Model. That's a convoluted term for a strategy to achieve two simple, common sense goals that go hand-in-hand: Enhanced care that leads to better health outcomes for Vermonters and smarter spending by hospitals and providers that is focused more on making people healthy and less on running tests and procedures to get paid.
 
Let me be clear about what the All Payer Model will mean for Vermonters:
 
 You will get to choose your provider and see the doctor whom you trust.
 
 Your doctor will get paid to keep you healthy, meaning they will get to spend the time they need with you and you will have a relationship that is more than a yearly 15-minute physical.
 
 And for those on Medicare, your benefits will not change.
 
The All Payer Model is about restoring the relationship between Vermonters and their family doctor or health care provider. It is no small irony that our future in health care is about restoring this decades old relationship that has been eroded under our current money-gobbling, fee-for-service, managed care system.
 
We have been working hand-in-hand with the Green Mountain Care Board to negotiate the terms of Vermont's All Payer Model with the federal government. Next week, we will detail for you what specifically we are asking of the federal government. It is my hope that we can come to terms with them quickly, and begin the transition to a new, better health care system that will save money and make Vermonters healthier. The Chair of the Green Mountain Care Board Al Gobeille is here today. Thank you Al for all your hard work.
 
Some will claim that we should stick with the system we have because change is scary. We can't. Under the fee-for-service system we have now we spend more on health care than anyone else in the world, and our outcomes are not as good -- we have higher infant mortality, higher obesity, and we don't live as long as the countries that are spending less than us. We must do better.
 
****
 
When I ran for this office, I said we must spend our tax dollars to educate Vermonters, not lock them up. We've done that. By getting non-violent addicts into treatment rather than jail, we have reduced Vermont's incarcerated population to the lowest level since the early 2000s. That has saved us nearly 50 million dollars, money we are now using to ensure universal pre-k for three and four-year-olds, school meals for all who need them, and dual enrollment and early college, which is giving more Vermont kids a free start on a higher education.
 
Today those efforts continue. My budget recommends that we close the work camp at the St. Johnsbury Correctional Facility because of our falling inmate population. Instead, let's use those savings to fund my Step Up program, which will help those in low-wage jobs get back on the academic track and the road to a brighter future. Let's use our tax dollars to educate, not incarcerate.
 
****
 
File this under something no one seems to know: Vermont currently charges the lowest mutual fund registration fee in New England. I am proposing we raise that fee to match the other New England states, which will raise over 13 million dollars, and use some of the additional revenue to fund a $250 college savings account for every child born in Vermont and a $500 savings account for low-income kids. Research shows that a college savings account can increase by three to four times the likelihood that low and moderate income kids will attend college. My proposed fee increase is modest -- it's half of what Massachusetts currently charges -- but the impact on Vermont kids will be great. Let's get this done.
 
****
 
My Administration has set a goal to end family homelessness by 2020, not only because we know it is the right thing to do but because we know that safe and stable homes serve as a platform for economic opportunity and community revitalization. That goal is achievable, but only if we commit ourselves to making it happen. That is why I am directing my Administration to develop a plan to ensure that 15 percent of taxpayer-funded housing in Vermont is dedicated to homeless families and those with special needs. My Agency of Human Services and Agency Commerce and Community Development will work with the Vermont Housing Conservation Board, our non-profit housing developers, service providers, my Poverty Council, and others to develop a pathway to make this happen. Working together, we can end family homelessness by 2020.
 
****
 
When Vermont took on the opiate and heroin crisis two years ago, we expanded the use of the overdose reversing drug naloxone because we refused to avert our eyes to neighbors dying in our streets from addiction. That single act has saved hundreds of lives. We will not turn back now. My budget includes funding to make permanent the naloxone pilot program that we launched two years ago, keep needle exchange programs operating across the state, and open a new treatment hub in northwestern Vermont that will treat an additional 400 Vermonters.

My budget will also provide resources for those on the front lines of the opiate and heroin battle, including 5 million dollars to fund positions for the Department of Children and Families, the judiciary, the States Attorneys, and the Defender General, as well as 2 million dollars to improve safety for state employees doing this important and difficult work.
 
****
 
It is time for our state to open our eyes to another disease that is too often kept as a family secret and spoken about in the same hushed whispers that I used to hear from victims of opiate addiction. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for Vermonters ages 15 to 34, and the third leading cause of death for those 35 to 44. We learned recently of the tragic loss of a Vermonter and my neighbor, Betsey Catlin of East Montpelier, when her family took the courageous step of publicly acknowledging her suicide. Betsey's obituary said that after a long struggle with depression, she ""ultimately decided she did not fit in this world."" Her dad Mark said that while Betsey tried to get by, ""she couldn't get by."" My heart goes out to the Catlin family and all the families across Vermont who have been impacted by suicide.
 
That's why my budget will almost double funding to the Vermont Suicide Prevention Center to ensure help is available for Vermonters who struggle to get by.
 
****
The budget I present today closes the General Fund budget gap of 68-million-dollars by trimming the projected growth rate by 38 million dollars and raising 30 million dollars from the mutual fund fee and expansion of the existing provider assessment. But we all know a budget is about more than an accounting of numbers or a collection of line-items. It is a document that puts into action our values, priorities, and hopes for a Vermont that is more secure for all who call this state home. Creating jobs and an economy that works for every Vermonter. Ensuring everyone has access to an education that will set them up to make a good living. Pursuing a rational criminal justice system. Improving a health care system that delivers on the promise of universal access at an affordable cost. Confronting addiction that threatens Vermont's quality of life.
 
The budget I present to you turns these values into action. I ask for your support. Thank you so much.",TRUE,Executive Address,03/03/16 09:03 AM
443,1045246,"Sessions Delivers Remarks in Opposition to Global ""Right To Migrate"" Amendment",12/10/15,6,"""With regards to immigration, it is the job of Congress to defend the rights and well-being of American citizens. That means we must look at how immigration is impacting Americans in their wages, in their salaries, in their national security.

It was five months ago that Kate Steinle died in her father's arms on a pier in San Francisco because a repeatedly deported criminal alien was set free. What about the American workers at Disney forced to train their guest worker replacements? They claim they were discriminated against because they were Americans. Where is the bill for them?

We have these fights over and over but we never seem to advance a bill or proposal that actually results in more protections for American citizens. 

So that is the context today in which we consider this unprecedented effort to extend American's constitutional rights and protections to foreign citizens living in foreign countries.

The adoption of the Leahy Amendment would constitute a transformation of our immigration system. In effect, it is a move toward the ratification of the idea that global migration is a ""human right,' and a civil right, and that these so-called 'immigrants' rights' must be supreme to the rights of sovereign nations to determine who can and cannot enter their borders.

Fundamentally, foreign nationals living in foreign countries have no constitutional right to enter the United States. If they did, any alien denied entry could file suit to demand entry and claim damages for lost employment, lost welfare benefits, lost income. 

Our immigration system derives exclusively from Article I, section 8, clause 4 of the United States Constitution, which vests the exclusive power in the Congress to establish a uniform system of immigration. Through acts of Congress, the United States can -- and does -- exclude aliens from entry into the United States for any reason provided by Congress.

The rules governing the selection of immigrants are, by definition, opposite the rules governing the treatment of citizens living or naturalized in the United States. There are 7 billion people in the world. Choosing who can immigrate into the United States is, by definition, an exclusionary process. The goal is to select immigrants for admission based on the benefits they provide to society based on skills, ages, values, philosophy, incomes, etc. Our goal is to choose for admission those likeliest to succeed and flourish and, crucially, to support our Constitutional system of government and our values of pluralism and Republican governance.

So whereas we consider it improper to deny employment to a U.S. citizen based on, say, their age, we consider it necessary and important to consider immigrants according to their age and whether they will be able to contribute productive years of work to American society.

As stated by the United States Supreme Court, ""Whatever the procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.'

What this amendment would do would be to turn this fundamental principle on its head, and to apply some of our core domestic legal and constitutional protections to foreign nationals with no tie to the United States. The natural extension of this concept would fundamentally undermine entire provisions of immigration law, and the results quickly become radical.

In the United States, we have protections against discrimination by religion, age, disability, country of origin, etc. We have freedom of association. Rights of due process.

Now imagine extending these as part of our immigration system. The logical extension of this concept results in a legal regime in which the United States cannot deny an alien admission to the United States based upon age, health, skill, family criminal history, country of origin, and so forth. If an elderly alien needing 24-hour medical care applied for entry and was denied, under this scheme of immigrant rights, they could file a lawsuit, demand entry and taxpayer funding.

But let's consider the question of religion more carefully. If we say it is improper to consider religion, then that means it is improper for a consular official to even ask about a candidate's religious beliefs when trying to screen an applicant for entry.

It would mean that even asking questions of a fiancé seeking a visa about his or her views on any religious matter -- say on the idea of pluralism vs. religious supremacy -- would be improper, because if it is improper to favor or disfavor a religion, it is improper to favor or disfavor any interpretation of a religion. Even if it is a perversion of a religion, it is still a religion to that person.

Are we really prepared to disallow, in the consideration of tens of millions of applications for entry to the United States, any questions about religious views and attitudes?

This amendment would mean, for instance, that the United States could not favor for entry the moderate Muslim cleric over the radical Muslim cleric. We have huge unrest in the Middle East. An argument has been made by some that we should prioritize resettling Muslim immigrants in the region and prioritizing the entry of persecuted Christians; this measure would forbid such considerations. Keep in mind, current refugee law requires us to consider persecution on account of an individual's religion; this would ask us to discard, or undermine, that longstanding practice.

A U.S.-born citizen who subscribes to theocratic Islam has a freedom of speech that allows him to give a sermon denouncing the U.S. constitution or demanding it be changed. But, under this amendment, a foreign religious leader living overseas could demand a tourist visa to deliver that same sermon and claim religious discrimination if it is not approved. I think it is a dangerous step.

The next step, of course, if we say religion cannot be considered in any way is to say we cannot consider history, or geography, or culture.

We need to make a holistic decision about applicants.

We cannot labor under the illusion that these are simple binary decisions. It is not as though every applicant is either clearly tied to terrorists on the one hand, or is absolutely safe on the other. Many people are radicalized after they enter. How do we screen for that possibility, if we cannot even ask about an applicant's views on religion? Would we forbid questions about politics? Or theology?

Furthermore, some of the same supporters of this very Amendment supported the ""Lautenberg Amendment' that gave special preferences for admission under our refugee program to Jews, Evangelical Christians, Orthodox Christians, Baha'is, and religious minorities -- all to the exclusion of others. The import of this is that hundreds of thousands of individuals have been admitted to the United States based exclusively on their religion.

The rights that have been neglected by this Congress are the rights of the American people. The rhetoric today would have you believe we have been operating some kind of closed-door immigration policy. The opposite is true. No nation on earth has ever let in more people over a shorter period of time. We have admitted 59 million immigrants since 1965. We have admitted 1.5 million immigrants from Muslim countries since 9/11. We have the largest foreign-born population in our history as a raw number, and soon the largest percentage of non-native-born in the history of the Republic. As a share of population, it will soon eclipse every historical record. Meanwhile, large companies are exploiting programs to replace American workers and undermine their wages. Poor screening has resulted in thousands of crimes against Americans. Our entitlement programs are stretched. Wages have been flattened for decades. Every year, we admit another 1 million permanent immigrants, nearly 100,000 refugees and asylees, and 700,000 foreign guest workers.

Though it appears that day will not be today, perhaps we should have a conversation soon about how to help the tens of millions of Americans who are only just barely scraping by.""

""Senator Leahy presents us a bold, dramatic Sense of the Senate resolution that strikes at our hearts and pulls at our values because we favor free exercise of religion. A serious discussion, colleagues, I believe, is needed before we take this step. Certainly, the point is pressed as a result of political statements, and I have tried to avoid commenting on those statements because I don't know how to firmly answer it. I don't know what the right response is, frankly. We need to be careful how we think about this. Certainly Jefferson and Madison spent years of contemplation and work on their founding of America's philosophies.

We celebrate America's commitment to the free exercise of religion.

The question of religion and the violence religious disagreements engendered in Europe prior to our founding were well known to the Founding Fathers. Jefferson and Madison had the answer they felt in the Virginia Statutes of Religious Freedom. Gary Wills writes insightfully about it in his book, ""Head and Heart'. We do not allow a religious test for holding office, we allow the free exercise of religion, and we ban the establishment of a State-sponsored church. It's in the Constitution explicitly.

Encompassed in the right of free exercise of religion is the duty to permit others to exercise their own religion, freely, and not in some diminished state. But, as with all rights, none can be absolute. I remember Federal Judge Virgil Pittman in Mobile agreeing to hear the petition of a prisoner who declared he was a Bishop in the Church of the New Song and that its doctrines called for steak and wine every Friday night and he demanded the federal prison provide it. After hearing his case, the Judge found his demands were not justified. Nor can a person declare their religion allows the use of illegal drugs. Nor use violence to enforce its doctrines, nor physically abuse women, nor marry underage children -- no matter how deeply held those views may be.

But, that's not the question here.

It is well settled that applicants don't have the constitutional right or civil right to demand entry to the United States. In fact, the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act] has this provision: ""whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interest of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he deems appropriate.' I assume similar provisions abound in most countries the world over. We accept those who we believe will advance the nation's interests. That's what secular states do -- and we are a secular government.

As leaders, we are to seek the advancement of the Public Interest. While billions of immigrants may benefit by moving to this country, this nation state has only one responsibility. We must decide if such an admission complies with our law and serves our national interest.

Now, religion is highly respected in America. Jefferson and Madison believed one's relationship to God was a matter between the believer and God. It was not a matter to be dictated by the state. Jefferson's words, chiseled in his monument, reflect this unique American view: ""I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.'

So, we must respect our brothers and sisters across this globe who have different views about God, faith, and religion, even as we may disagree. In America, we even value free discussion as a method of reaching higher truth -- even changing our minds or another's mind in the course. Wills says -- as I remember, Washington, and others at the time, used the phrase ""toleration' of other religious views. But, he says, Jefferson and Madison went further, giving more respect to dissenting views than mere toleration.

Based on Supreme Court interpretations of the Constitution, we can say with confidence that the establishment of an immigration policy has been given to the Congress. Congress has not given rights to foreigners to go to court to demand entry into the United States. Neither does the Constitution. That is plain fact.

Senator Leahy's resolution doesn't explicitly assert that his demands are required by the law or the Constitution, but on America's founding principles. He insists we must all agree that it is ""un-American' to deny entry into America on account of one's religion. Un-American is a strong word. Liberals have never liked it used against their world visions. The Communists certainly didn't like it used. To affirm such a resolution would mean that religion can never be taken into account to determine admissibility -- throughout all the ages this great Republic might exist.

I think we must apply a prudent cast of mind to our analysis. If there are circumstances we can foresee that would cause open-minded, logical, fair persons acting in the national interest to decide to act contrary to this resolution, and to be morally and legally justified in so doing, then it must not pass. We have conducted no analysis of this prospect. Unless we are sure, we cannot pass such a broad resolution.

Most religions focus on one's relationship with God. But, many religions are much broader, covering all aspects of life -- including government, public policy, and law. Religions today too often are underappreciated for the good they do. In marriage, in divorce, in birth, in death, in sickness, in health, in poverty, and in wealth, religious faith, in millions, in billions of daily actions, is a force for good. Reality would be denied, however, if we do not recognize that dangerous and damaging religions and sects have arisen. At least at some points in history, most religions, or segments of them, have sought to overcome human laws and rules and impose doctrinal ideas that are contrary to good common sense and good policy, even seek to destroy established governments because they perceive that God has ordered them to do so. We may say this is not religion. But, the adherents would say it is religion indeed. They say they are adhering to their text, their leader, or their revelation. Didn't the people of Jonestown believe theirs was a religion, even as they took their own lives? Don't suicide bombers think they are religiously faithful? There are countless other examples that need not be listed.

What if a strong and growing religion believes that their leader directly talks to God, believes that existing world governments are satanic and corrupt and must be violently overthrown? They insist that the divine solution is a theocracy where God alone rules and rules justly, and now the time has come to move to challenge America to carry out their evangelization?

Secretary Carter says ISIS is growing. What if it expands ever more rapidly and decides to focus its believers on a long-term effort to change the corrupt America? And their doctrines justify force, do they not? Can we say that ISIS's form of religion is not a religion just because it is not consistent with classical Islam? Why could they not demand as strong a right to enter as a peaceful meditating Buddhist? Is it in the national interest to admit the ISIS member equally with the Buddhist?  Is it wrong to say that immigration must serve the legitimate interests of America and that others are more likely than those committed to violent ideologies? After all, we can't admit everybody.

Is it better to admit those who admire America, affirm its constitutional order, than those who would be unhappy and unfulfilled until their vision for the country more closely parallels their religious vision -- a government faithful to their theology? A theocracy?

Again, sometimes religions believe that their goals go beyond personal salvation. They believe they are commanded to control the government and their doctrines must dominate over other religions, denying them freedom. Such religious people would have an unhappy time in the United States.

Maybe Senator Leahy's resolution is correct. Maybe the common sense interests of our nation must fall to this rather extreme vision. But, I do not think so. This is a dangerous injunction, colleagues. It goes beyond being unwise. It is reckless. It is absolute and without qualification. It could have pernicious impacts for decades, even centuries to come. It may be even a step from the concept of the nation-state to the idea of ""global citizenship.'

Such understandings have never been part of our immigration law. The resolution lacks limits. Let's not act quickly, let's think this through. In a time of intense political debate, we do not need to be reacting to make political points. Let's think deeply about what this means and what the ramifications of it might be. I urge a no vote on the Leahy resolution.""",TRUE,"In a statement, Senator Sessions outlines his objections to a proposed ""Right to Migrate"" amendment, specifically how the amendment will, in his view, tie the hands of the government to deny dangerous people access to the United States.",03/07/16 11:36 AM
