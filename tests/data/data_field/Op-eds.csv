49210,1104271,Foxs News Opinion - House Homeland Security Chairman: A Republican Plan to Lead on National Security,06/09/16,9,"The verdict is in: President Obama has been the worst foreign policy president in our lifetimes. 

His strategy of ""leading from behind"" has led us into danger, and as a result, the American people are far less secure than they were eight years ago.

That is why this week we will release the House Republican agenda for restoring our national security and reestablishing U.S. influence in the world.

Earlier this year, House Speaker Paul Ryan put together a task force to write this blueprint.  Our goal was not only to reverse the damage done by the Obama administration, but also to present a vision for how Republicans would govern in 2017 and beyond.

We had our work cut out for us. For years, the White House has appeased rather than opposed our adversaries, allowing them to threaten our interests around the globe.  In the meantime, America's retreat has shaken the confidence of our allies, who are now reluctant to act and who question our commitments.

Simply put, our friends no longer trust us, our foes no longer fear us, and new enemies are plotting against us.

Nowhere is this clearer than with the threat of terrorism.  Extremists are not on the run, as the president claims, they are on the march and spreading like a worldwide wildfire. And in many ways, our own city streets have become the frontlines.  Islamist militants are recruiting our people -- online and across borders -- and inspiring massacres like the one we saw last year in San Bernardino.

The resurgence of radicalism is not a fluke.  It is a consequence of failed leadership.  The president's reluctance to act has allowed more terrorist sanctuaries to develop overseas than at any time in modern history, giving extremists the space to recruit, train, and plot attacks. The result is that we are in the highest terror threat environment since 9/11.

But the danger is not just from terrorists.  Our adversaries--like Russia, China, and Iran--have taken advantage of America sitting on the sidelines by expanding their reach, challenging our interests, and supplanting our influence.  This has made the world less safe for the United States and other free nations.

It is time to turn the page and outline a better way.  Our agenda spells out how we can achieve U.S. security through leadership and liberty, relying on four main pillars:

- Keeping Americans safe at home

- Defeating terrorists

- Defending freedom and advancing American interests

- Renewing our national security tools.

In each of these areas, we put forward time-tested principles and bold ideas for making sure the United States remains secure and unmatched in its strength.  For instance, here at home, we explain how we will keep extremists from reaching our territory, secure our borders once and for all, and ratchet up our cyber defenses.

Our agenda is also guided by a belief that if we do not shape the world, it will shape us, which is why we must be unafraid to do whatever is necessary to defend our country and our interests abroad.  This includes shoring up our alliances, especially across the Atlantic, and standing up to hostile foreign governments when they threaten us.

We will not be apologetic about our nation's might nor our actions to protect our people.  Indeed, we have learned all-too-well in the last eight years that a policy of apologies leads to a world of catastrophes.

In the long run, the United States must ensure the global balance of power favors free countries like our own, which is why we are committed to promoting prosperity through open markets and strategic investments.  We also know from experience that regions of lawlessness and tyranny are breeding grounds for extremists, so we believe America must continue its longstanding drive to expand the community of free societies.

Finally, our agenda underscores how we intend to reform our broken government bureaucracies to conduct smarter diplomacy, build a stronger military, and honor those who serve by making sure we take care of veterans and their families.

House Republicans have no illusions about the challenge before us.  Leading from the front is not easy, but it is our responsibility--to our ancestors, our people, and future generations.

America is the world's most exceptional and indispensable nation, and with the defense of liberty as our guiding light, we will keep it that way.

ISIS. So-called ""soldiers of the caliphate."" Soft-targets and casualties, the list goes on. Add to that heroin and drug-related burglaries; we must be vigilant.

But let's pause a minute this Fourth of July and remember our heroes. They would want us to smile in confidence, love God and family, and be brave. Like the valor of our Armed Forces. Men like Navy SEAL Michael Monsoor, whose story is depicted in the movie ""Act of Valor."" And Marylander Emily Perez, the first female West Point graduate to die in combat for America.

So hold fast, keep the faith. In God we still trust. And let's get to work.

In Congress, I plan to draft and seek to pass a National Home and Community Defense Act.

First, the act will provide basic training for home and community defense. During WWII, the Civil Air Patrol provided a means for citizens to help defend our communities and it still has a proud tradition of doing so. For defense, we can also train citizens via local fire and police departments.

Second, the act will include the opportunity for all able-bodied people to be armed and trained, with possible tax credits as incentives. The Second Amendment exists for arming citizens; Switzerland does this and we can too.

Third, the act will include interstate reciprocity for concealed carry holders across state lines. Time and again quick-thinking armed citizens stop mass shootings, saving lives.

Fourth, we need a comprehensive approach to securing the border and stopping the heroin epidemic. This is why I also support comprehensive addiction recovery, to make our communities safer.

These are common-sense measures for our security.

But I can't do this unless we protect the other House -- the U.S. House of Representatives. Congress does not need a politician like my opponent, an open atheist and socialist who authored the gun ban in Maryland. He has a right to his opinions and beliefs, but so do we.

I believe District 8 needs a congressman who follows the Constitution and defends the rights of the people which come from our Creator. That is my duty. Please join me. Go to www.coxforcongress.org. Enjoy the Fourth of July and keep smiling!",,,07/06/16 03:29 PM
59849,1104433,Published in Marin Indepedent Journal- Marin Voice: More Honesty Needed in Congress Tax Debate,03/01/16,9,"It's tax season, when Americans descend into the U.S. tax code and return bewildered and/or enraged.

Our tax code is riddled with loopholes. Some large corporations pay nothing. Others pay their full share. Oil companies get special perks unavailable to other industries. And the super-rich enjoy tax breaks unavailable to working families.

Our tax code is also failing to raise enough revenue to pay our nation's bills -- despite the lowest level of discretionary federal spending since at least 1962. Thanks to unfunded wars, ill-conceived tax cuts and a global recession, we haven't seen a balanced budget since the Clinton administration. Our national debt is $18.1 trillion and growing.

We need a tax code that is understandable, fair, and fiscally responsible -- one that ""helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy,"" as President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address.

Unfortunately, the 114th Congress is off to a bad start on tax policy.

House Republicans who call themselves ""deficit hawks"" just passed two bills making permanent tax changes without addressing the $100 billion hit to the deficit. The debate defied conventional wisdom: Democrats proposed amendments to offset the deficit impact, while Republicans voted the amendments down and gave flowery speeches about how unfunded tax deductions for food banks were critical in the ""fight against hunger,"" an abrupt political pivot from recent GOP attempts to slash $40 billion from Food Stamps.

We saw the same partisan posturing last year. House Republicans singled out popular tax breaks that were expiring in 2015 and held votes to permanently extend them without any offset, ballooning the deficit by $800 billion. They spoke of needy constituencies that benefit from these tax breaks, ignoring previous GOP votes to slash vital programs for the same constituencies.

These orchestrated ""gotcha"" votes are a familiar game used for setting up attack ads in the next election (""Why did your congressman vote against charitable donations to fight hunger?""). Democrats do the same thing with clever ""motions to recommit"" to trap Republicans into uncomfortable votes.

These political games must end.

But there's a broader, more sinister strategy here: Creating deficit pressure to drive harsh cuts in the social safety net. We see it in the Republican push to lift ""sequester"" budget constraints for defense spending. And in the House Rules change spearheaded by Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Chairman Ryan believes fiscal impacts of legislation should be evaluated by ""dynamic scoring"" that assumes tax cuts magically pay for themselves. ""Dynamic scoring"" is a farce; it applies to tax cuts but not to investments in infrastructure or education. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, like most credible economists, rejects it outright. So Chairman Ryan changed the rules to force CBO to use ""dynamic scoring."" This lets House Republicans pretend that cutting taxes is always great for the economy and the budget, and investments in things like infrastructure and schools simply drain the budget without any economic benefits.

Last year, Chairman Ryan said: ""if Washington is serious about helping families, then it needs to get serious about the national debt."" I agree. But inflating the deficit with unpaid-for tax policies and defense spending while cooking the books with ""dynamic scoring"" is not getting serious; it's playing politics. America deserves better.

Like most Democrats, I support the charitable deduction and many other tax breaks. We should extend them, but let's be honest about how we do that.

I won't play into a cynical strategy to force harsh cuts that hurt the very families and institutions I want to help. If we're truly serious about the national debt, let's find a bipartisan way to fund these tax extenders--closing loopholes, new revenues, or cuts somewhere other than vital social services.

We can improve our tax code and get our fiscal house in order, but it's going to require more honesty and less partisan theater than we've seen so far in this Congress.",,,07/06/16 04:29 PM
59849,1104448,Published in North Bay Bohemian- Not Down with TPP: The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a Bad Deal,06/04/16,9,"Instead of unifying the United States and Pacific Rim nations behind an aggressive greenhouse-gas-reduction plan, the proposed Trans-Pacific Parternership (TTP) trade agreement could threaten our forests, wildlife, oceans, climate, public health and middle-class jobs. It would spur natural gas exports and increase fracking, putting our water at risk and further cementing our addiction to fossil fuel.

The TPP, like previous bad trade deals, allows corporations to challenge local, state and even national laws they don't like. Last month, the World Trade Organization (WTO) sided with foreign beef producers in a complaint challenging a U.S. law that requires beef and pork to include country-of-origin labeling. The WTO held that this law violates trade rules, and thus our trading ""partners"" may soon impose massive sanctions on American wine and other products unless the labeling law is repealed.

This is nothing new. It's how a foreign corporation challenged California's law protecting groundwater from the volatile gasoline additive MTBE, how the tobacco industry pressured New Zealand into repealing a law against underage smoking and how NAFTA was used to challenge Quebec's fracking ban.

Worse, the public has no opportunity to read or analyze the TPP. The text is a complete mystery except to those writing the deal and a few ""cleared advisers"" and corporate executives who, like me and my colleagues in Congress, are prohibited from telling the public what the document says.

The House of Representatives will soon vote on ""fast track"" authority to grease the skids for a vote on the TPP. But it's not just President Obama who would receive this authority; it will last six years, meaning the next presidents, whoever they are, could use it to jam new trade deals through Congress. I am not comfortable with the WTO deciding whether the Clean Water Act or Dodd-Frank financial reforms constitute restraints of trade under a trade deal cut by, say, President Scott Walker.

Some dismiss this as speculation, but congressional Republicans could easily fix the problem by narrowing the ""fast track"" bill to one year and limiting it to the TPP. Their refusal suggests to me that the warnings have real merit, and I will be opposing ""fast track"" status for the trade agreement.",,,07/06/16 04:35 PM
59849,1104455,Published in Sacramento Bee- California's Water Strategy Deserves an Open Debate and Real Solutions,06/17/16,9,"In response to the worst drought in our state's long memory, our public institutions -- with one unfortunate exception -- are stepping up.

Gov. Jerry Brown and the Legislature passed long-overdue groundwater and sustainable water investments through last year's $7.5 billion water bond. Local governments and water districts are launching conservation plans to preserve dwindling water supplies. The Obama administration is providing millions in emergency grants to drought-stricken communities and farmers.

But even though natural disasters typically garner bipartisan congressional responses, House Republicans have treated the drought as a political opportunity instead of a moral imperative. They've dusted off the same political agenda they've pursued for years -- weakening environmental laws, gutting fishery protections and redirecting water needed by other regions -- and tried to sell it as a drought response.

California deserves better than the predictable ""blame the fish"" carnival. We cannot condemn ""inconvenient"" salmon runs to extinction, pre-empt state water rights, or declare winners and losers among the state's drought-stricken regions.

That's why I developed the kind of serious, comprehensive legislation this crisis demands.

Right now, that means providing emergency funding to stretch existing water supplies: deploying efficient irrigation technology, drilling wells and building pipelines. It also means helping out-of-work farmworkers and combating upstream water theft on federal lands. We need to act -- right now.

Our long-term needs are even greater. Scientists warn we're likely to experience more frequent and severe droughts due to climate change, stressing our environment and straining water supplies. We must become more drought resilient, and we can start with our chronically underfunded clean-water infrastructure. By fully funding existing programs, we can quickly upgrade treatment facilities, repair leaking pipes, and improve urban and agricultural water use efficiency. We need to rethink how we manage headwater forests and watersheds and recharge depleted groundwater aquifers.

California -- the home of innovation -- should be using cutting-edge drought responses. The Army Corps of Engineers needs to join the 21st century and operate reservoirs based on the latest science and satellite forecasts, not crude flood predictions from 1960s-era manuals. We need major federal investments to clean up contaminated aquifers, improve desalination technology and dramatically expand water recycling.

We also need to plan for the worst.

We call in the National Guard when floods overwhelm a state, but when communities run dry, we have no plans to deploy military resources -- including mobile desalination technology. Disaster response agencies should start planning for the worst right now. Fisheries managers should prepare, too, for years of warmer, depleted streams. We can't just keep lurching from one crisis to the next.

My bill reflects four basic principles that should guide Congress in responding to this and future droughts:

1. Do no harm. Ours is a complex system, and we should not redirect impacts or micromanage it from Washington.

2. No water wars. End attempts to gut environmental laws and take water from other regions. Solutions must respect environmental and water quality laws, and benefit every region impacted by this drought.

3. Think long-term. We should respond not just to the immediate crisis but build drought resiliency for the future.

4. Process matters. Successful water initiatives require transparency, inclusiveness and deliberation. Backroom deals and secret water grabs invariably create more problems than they solve.

I've been reaching out to stakeholders, economists, farmers, conservationists and California's top water managers to make my bill the best it can be. Before I formally introduce it, I'd like you to join them in giving your feedback. Please visit Huffman.house.gov/drought to read this draft legislation.

Our water future deserves an open debate leading to real solutions. I'll hope you'll join in.",,,07/06/16 04:40 PM
26979,1104562,Published in Time Magazine- Reps. Conyers and Rangel: Trump's Bigotry Reminds Us of Strom Thurmond,06/27/16,9,"By Charles Rangel and John Conyers

As veterans who have fought for our country abroad and then at home, we simply cannot stay silent while un-American attacks on other minority groups are given voice'

Some six decades ago, we left our homes in Detroit and New York City to serve in the Korean War. We were both young men in our early 20s, afraid but resolute. We would both be decorated for our service, and Charlie would be severely wounded in the Battle of Kunu-ri. We would both fight to defend democracy on the Korean Peninsula.

In Korea, we fought as part of the first truly integrated armed forces our nation had ever known. The near defeat of U.S.-led forces in the early days of the conflict led to rapid integration after three years of delaying implementation of President Harry Truman's 1948 order to desegregate our Army and Navy. This led to a certain level of meritocracy: Charlie would rise to Staff Sergeant, and John would serve as an officer.

However, when we returned home we were quickly reminded that we were not just veterans--we were black veterans. Commendation medals did not mean we could sit in the front of the bus in Alabama, and a Purple Heart did not protect black veterans from racist landlords, employers, businesses or police. Our service didn't trump our race.

Today, Donald Trump is fomenting a movement to bring back that shameful period in time by alienating groups who have fought and died for our freedoms. In the ""Great America"" that Donald Trump talks about, people of Mexican descent are not soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines--or judges--they are drug dealers, rapists and thieves. To Trump, Muslim immigrants are not allies who had to flee persecution because their assistance to U.S. forces endangered their lives--every single one is a potential terrorist who should be subject to special police laws. Both groups of citizens--Hispanics and Muslims--are clearly unfit to serve as judges in Trump's America. Like the segregationists of our youth, no amount of national service seems to overcome Trump's belief that a person's race and religion make him or her less American.

As we have said, Trump's hair-brained bigotry is nothing original. Indeed, his sort of prejudiced campaign does not even predate our service to our country. In 1948, the year we both put on U.S. Army uniforms, Strom Thurmond won 39 electoral votes as the nominee of the Dixiecrats. But Trump's dangerous provocations--the forced expulsion of 11 million people and the creation of secret police and special religious ghettos for Muslims--represent crimes that we simply did not travel half a world a way to defend.

That Trump has never served in uniform--his boarding school experience excepted--is painfully obvious when he speaks. And we are not just referring to his shameful comments about Senator John McCain and prisoners of war. He has clearly never had to put his life at risk for our nation. If he had, he would know the same thing we learned from bullets and bombs as young men--on the battlefield, one's skin color or the name of his God is the last thing that matters.

A Commander-in-Chief is responsible for the lives of all our fighting men and women: 158,000 of those soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen identify as Hispanic or Latino, and more than 5,000 of them are Muslim. Trump simply cannot fulfill the constitutional duties of the presidential office by questioning the patriotism, integrity and devotion of one out of eight U.S. service men and women. Nor should a man who wants to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, our military ally--a nation with whom we last fought an armed conflict in 1919--receive command of a military that has been through enough unnecessary dust and bloodshed.

Unfortunately, Congressional Republicans are starting to take their cues from their nominee, with all but 20 of them voting last week to end enlistment programs that grants citizenship status to undocumented immigrants who came here as children, who already have legal residency in the United States, and who simply want to serve in our Armed Forces. This trend is disturbing. It is one thing for a fringe political candidate who won a plurality of G.O.P. voters to suggest such dangerous polices; it is another for Congressional Republicans to pick up and carry that flag in the House.

As veterans who have fought for our country abroad and then at home, we simply cannot stay silent while un-American attacks on other minority groups are given voice.

8749,1104605,Macomb Daily Columns - Peters: MMTC helps boost Macomb County Manufacturing Sector,06/24/16,9,"By Senator Gary Peters

From autos to aerospace and defense, manufacturing has always been the heart of our economy in Michigan and Macomb County. The vast majority of American manufacturing companies are small or medium-sized businesses, employing fewer than 500 workers. These small and mid-sized manufacturers are driving innovation, creating good-paying jobs and bolstering our economic competitiveness around the world.

We can help support these smaller manufacturers as they grow and strengthen their businesses by ensuring they have access to the resources and support services that will help them succeed. Michigan is home to the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center (MMTC), which has been working on projects since 1991 with more than 2000 Michigan small manufacturing companies--including 35 companies employing more than 2,100 workers in Macomb County over the last three years--as they develop effective businesses leaders, promote innovation and generate new strategies for growth.

MMTC is Michigan's affiliate for the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, or MEP, which has provided vital support services to small and mid-sized manufacturers for nearly 30 years. The MEP program is a partnership between federal, state, and local governments and private sector entities. Built on a nationwide network of affiliate centers in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, MEP centers serve as trusted business advisors and technical experts to small and medium-sized manufacturers. The MEP program helps manufacturers grow their businesses to compete on a global scale -- creating stronger companies, retaining and creating good-paying jobs and boosting local economies. In fact, every dollar invested in the MEP program generates $17 in new sales growth.

I am committed to supporting Michigan manufacturers' efforts to be global leaders in innovation and advanced manufacturing. That is why I recently introduced the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Improvement Act to expand the MEP program and help more small and medium-sized manufacturers access the vital resources, information, training and technologies that affiliates like MMTC provide. This legislation will also support the development of apprenticeships, internships, and certification programs that can help train the next generation of workers to fulfill critical roles in our growing manufacturing sector.

Through the MEP program, companies across Macomb County have been able to strengthen their businesses and grow the local economy. For example, PCMI Manufacturing Integration in Shelby Township worked with MMTC to expand their metal casting and carbon fiber molding business in the automotive and aerospace markets beyond their initial short-run and prototype production. With the help of MMTC and the MEP program, PCMI Manufacturing Integration was able to diversify and grow their production capability, increasing their workforce by 30 percent and new sales by 25 percent.

MMTC also helped Clinton Township-based Omega Plastics expand their company's tooling and injection molding production to a wide range of industries, including automotive, medical devices and consumer packaging. Through the MEP program, Omega Plastics was able to secure more than 25 customers in new markets around the world and make critical investments in their business to continue designing improved products for their customers.

These are just a few of the many success stories for Macomb County manufacturers who have used the MEP program to improve their efficiency, productivity and profitability. A vibrant manufacturing sector is the key to our nation's economic competitiveness, and Congress must help support America's small and medium-sized manufacturers as they look to grow. The MEP program is a proven investment that ensures American small manufacturers can continue to drive innovation, enhance economic growth and expand opportunities for our future workforce.",,,07/07/16 08:53 AM
8749,1104634,"Between the Lines News - After Orlando, The Fight For Equality Goes On",06/30/16,9,"By Senator Gary Peters

In the same month - and more significantly during Pride Month - when we are celebrating the one-year anniversary of marriage equality, we are also mourning the loss of 49 Americans who were killed and 53 others who were wounded in not just the worst mass shooting in our nation's history, but a clearly targeted attack against the LGBT community.

Our country has made great strides towards equality for all Americans. In recent years, public polling has shown that hearts and minds across the country are becoming increasingly supportive of LGBT rights. LGBT members of our armed forces can now serve their country openly. And in every state across our country, LGBT people are guaranteed the freedom to marry the person they love. These are important triumphs in the fight for equality, and we should take time to celebrate these hard-won achievements.

But as we come to the end of this year's Pride Month, the events in Orlando serve as a stark reminder that the fight for equality in this nation for LGBT Americans must not end with marriage equality. We still live in a nation where Americans face discrimination - and can be bullied, fired, evicted, denied credit or services and even killed - simply because of their sexuality or gender identity.

For too many LGBT Americans, violence and discrimination are serious and relentless problems. According to Southern Poverty Law Center, LGBT Americans face an extremely high risk of being targeted by hate crimes. Transgender people, especially transgender women of color, face even higher rates of violence. In 2015 alone, 21 transgender people were the victims of deadly violence, many as the direct result of anti-transgender bias, including two transgender people in Detroit.

Although some communities have taken steps to promote the equal treatment of every individual, the vast majority of states have fallen woefully short of ensuring legal protections against discrimination regularly experienced by the LGBT community. In 37 states, including Michigan, LGBT Americans seeking a loan to start a business or buy a home can be denied credit. In 32 states, including Michigan, LGBT people can be barred from purchasing goods in a shop, keeping a job where they earn a decent living, finding housing in a safe neighborhood or even using a public bathroom. We cannot ignore the fact that in many places, LGBT Americans not only lack legal protections, they face active campaigns targeting their access to basic rights.

This kind of bigotry harms LGBT people who are trying to do what many other Americans take for granted -- find opportunity, strive for success and lead fulfilling lives. This bigotry directly contributed to the violence that not only ended lives in Orlando, but shattered a symbol of safety for the LGBT community - a gathering place to enjoy music, dancing and the space to just be themselves.

Our country was founded on the principles of equality, freedom and justice, but we cannot live up to the full promise of these ideals until LGBT Americans are afforded the same legal rights as other Americans. I was proud to help introduce the Equality Act to expand non-discrimination protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity and finally ban discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations and other areas for LGBT Americans in every state across the country. Our Constitution guarantees equal protection under law, and I will keep working with my colleagues in Congress to defend the rights of all Americans.

Though our hearts are heavy in the wake of the tragedy in Orlando, over the last few weeks we have seen many communities come together and lift up the message that love overcomes hate. It's not always easy to do what is right. It takes tremendous courage to rise up in the face of discrimination, hatred and outright violence to stand for justice and equal rights. I am honored to stand with Michigan's LGBT community to champion equal rights and celebrate the diversity and unity that makes our nation so uniquely strong.",,,07/07/16 09:03 AM

Casey Jo Schulte was a swimmer, a dancer. She dreamed of being a nurse. But that dream was cut short. After a bout of digestive pain, her doctor prescribed opioid pain medication, and last August, her life was stolen by an overdose.

We heard Casey Jo's story last month at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation treatment center. With tears in her eyes, Casey Jo's mom, Shelly Elkington of Montevideo, told us about how much she loved her daughter, how much she missed her. During that same discussion, we heard from other Minnesota families who have lost sons and daughters to prescription opioid and heroin use disorders, along with leaders from across the state's medical, law enforcement and treatment communities, to discuss concrete solutions to end this epidemic.

And it is an epidemic.

Roughly four out of every five heroin users get their start misusing prescription drugs. Nearly half the people in our country know someone with a prescription opioid use disorder. On average, we lose almost 80 American lives every day to prescription opioid and heroin overdoses.

As Shelly reminded us at Hazelden, ""This epidemic is man-made. We need to own it. And we need to fix it.""

Shelly is right. We must respond to this crisis. Bipartisan legislation has passed the U.S. House and Senate, and the president has called for an additional $1.1 billion to make sure that every American with an opioid-use disorder who wants treatment can get the help he or she needs.

This builds on work being done to expand the use of tools that are effective in reducing drug use and overdose. These include evidence-based prevention programs, prescriber education, prescription drug monitoring, safe drug disposal, medication-assisted treatment and the overdose reversal drug naloxone.

Just a decade ago, only 20 states had prescription-drug monitoring programs in place. Today, nearly every state does, including Minnesota. But simply having a PDMP isn't enough -- it has to be used by all prescribers. Unfortunately that still isn't the case.

During our discussion, we heard the story of a patient who filled 108 prescriptions for painkillers from more than 85 different prescribers throughout Minnesota. To stop this kind of doctor shopping, many states are requiring all prescribers to use their PDMPs.

Every day we lose more Americans to this devastating disease. And every day that passes without more funding to support the treatment needs of those suffering from opioid use disorders is a missed opportunity to save lives.

Millions of Americans are in recovery from opioid and other substance use disorders because they got the treatment and care they needed. We need a comprehensive approach to confront this crisis. That means making sure health care providers have the right training and tools to save lives, and that means providing the resources needed to ensure that every American who wants treatment can get it.

135894,1104864,Vote for Rep. Jim Bridenstine,04/28/16,9,"By The Editorial Board
Four years ago, U.S. Rep. Jim Bridenstine said he would not vote for John Boehner as Speaker of the House.

Even though he was threatened and told he would lose key committee assignments, Bridenstine stayed true to his word and voted against the Republican Speaker.

And he lost no committee assignments.

Bridenstine is running for his third and final term in the House. He said he would run three times and step down and that is what he plans to do.

Part of problem in Congress is that career politicians get elected and stay elected forever. Term limits in the Oklahoma Legislature has had a serious effect on breaking up the good old boy network and pumping accountability  back into the process. Bridenstine is unquestionably conservative and arguably the most popular politician in Oklahoma because he does what he says he will do.

Bridenstine's extensive military background is invaluable. His education in economics helps shape legislative opinion as he tries to get America back on solid financial ground.

Bridenstine is an ardent supporter of the right to life. He is a champion for the right to bear arms and he fights constantly to preserve the religious freedoms that are supposed to be enforced from the Constitution. Rep. Bridenstine is  genuine conservative, one of the smartest members of the House and a devoted father and family man.

16553,1104887,Op-Ed By Duncan Hunter: Jones Act a lifeline for Puerto Rico and even bigger booster for U.S. national security,06/08/16,9,"The Jones Act--which requires that U.S. built and crewed shipping vessels move goods between U.S. ports--has always been a target for Wall Street and corporatists.  No surprise there.  What does come as a surprise, however, is how quick some conservatives are to side with corporate interests in the assault on the Jones Act, ignoring its contribution to the economy and U.S. security.  All of it in the name of profits.   

This week's op-ed entitled ""Are Jones Act ships really 'made in the USA'? Well, sort of"" unfairly misconstrues the essential benefits of the Jones Act.  The author would have one believe that the U.S. Shipbuilding industry maintains very little capacity to build ships on its own and that there is no benefit in the Jones Act and the maritime industry it supports.  Nothing could be further from the truth. 

It's true that certain naval parts are acquired from abroad, but what the author fails to mention is the heavy-industrial infrastructure and significant skill sets based in our country, and the obvious risk of further outsourcing both.  American shipyards, naval architects, welders, engineers and mariners who work to build and crew Jones Act ships can certainly attest to this.    

As for the benefits of the Jones Act, which are misrepresented by dubious claims of higher costs and stifled completion, the American Maritime Industry contributes $100 billion dollars in economic benefits and half million jobs to the U.S. economy. 

And as strong as the economic arguments are, the national security arguments are just as compelling--if not more.  The Jones Act helps ensure we will have the necessary industrial infrastructure, and skilled labor pool of welders, fitters and sailors needed to rapidly mobilize in times of war.  We must never rely on another country for this type of labor or to support U.S. force projection. 

Don't just take my word for it.  General Paul Selva, former TRANSCOM Commander and current Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated last year, "" I can stand before any group as a military leader and say without the contribution that the Jones Act brings to the support of our industry there is a direct threat to national defense, and I will not be bashful about saying it and I will not be silent.""  Many others in the national security community share his views.

This week, as part of the larger discussion on addressing Puerto Rico's finances, opponents of the Jones Act will likely attempt their worn-out efforts to weaken the Jones Act.  The law's opponents claim that relieving Puerto Rico of Jones Act requirements will strengthen Puerto Rico's economy and boost competition.  The reality is that Puerto Rico's economic challenges are not driven by the Jones Act and there is already robust competition--with nearly two-thirds of the vessels calling on Puerto Rico being foreign flagged.

All that eliminating the Jones Act for Puerto Rico will do is degrade our national security and undermine the American Maritime Industry, along with the thousands of jobs it supports.",,,07/07/16 10:42 AM
26972,1104909,Published in the Huffington Post Blog- Saddam Hussein's Legacy and American Leadership Today,07/06/16,9,"By Eliot Engel

Today in the Foreign Affairs Committee, we heard testimony about Palestinian terrorists collecting payments for attacks on the Israeli people.  The campaign of incitement and hatred waged by Palestinian leaders is bad enough, but the idea of authorities putting cash in the hands of cold-blooded killers is just disgusting.  We know that a peaceful two-state solution will never happen so long as this practice continues.

Listening to our witnesses, I was reminded of the worst precedent we've seen for this sort of blood money: Saddam Hussein. In the last years Saddam was in power in Iraq, he paid the relatives of suicide bombers thousands of dollars.  In the month after he increased payments from $10,000 to $25,000, a dozen suicide bombers blew themselves up in Israel, killing scores of innocent people.  This history is disturbing, but hardly out of character for Saddam. After all, this is the man who used chemical weapons in the mass murder of his own citizens.

So when I heard this morning that the presumptive Republican nominee for the Presidency of the United States praised--yet again--Saddam Hussein as some sort of tough-guy leader, I could hardly believe it.  The Iraq war was an unmitigated disaster and we were led into by false pretenses.  But one fact is absolutely certain: Saddam Hussein was one of the worst figures of the 20th century and the world is a better place without him in it. 

Anyone to whom that isn't crystal clear is utterly unqualified to hold any position of responsibility, let alone to be Commander-in-Chief.

The eyes of the world are on the United States right now. Our economy, military, and influence are the strongest of any country in the world.  That strength comes with the responsibility of projecting peace and stability. So when a candidate for our highest office says that we should abandon our alliances; or suggests that more countries should have nuclear weapons; or muses that we should stay neutral in Israeli-Palestinian issues; or alienates entire groups because of their faith; or threatens a trade war; or praises leaders such as Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, and--yes--Saddam Hussein, it casts doubt on America's ability to be a global leader.

As Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I hear from world leaders and diplomats who are deeply concerned about what could happen if such reckless ideas were actually allowed to guide American foreign policy.  In their view, there are too many challenges around the world to risk turning power over to someone who obviously has no real grasp of the issues and seems not to have any interest in learning about them.  I couldn't agree more.

In the years ahead, American leadership around the world may be more important than at any point in history.  From countering violent extremism to seizing new opportunities in Asia to supporting development in Africa to dealing with tyrannical leaders, the way the United States acts on the global stage will have tremendous repercussions.  We need steady, smart leadership, not people who look to Saddam Hussein as a good example.",,,07/07/16 10:50 AM
135894,1104935,Congress Can and Should Still Defund Planned Parenthood,12/03/15,9,"By Jim Bridenstine
Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider and harvests and sells baby parts. Federal funding for Planned Parenthood should stop. Congress can and should defund Planned Parenthood in the pending ""Omnibus"" spending bill.

Rather than confront Harry Reid and President Obama, some Republicans in Congress have asserted that defunding Planned Parenthood is impossible. In October, I asked the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) to examine Congress' ability to defund Planned Parenthood. The CRS report unequivocally shows that Congress can indeed stop federal funding to Planned Parenthood and its affiliates should it chose to do so. It's a question of will and commitment to principle.

Federal spending falls into three categories: discretionary, mandatory, and interest payments on the national debt. The vast majority of federal funding for Planned Parenthood comes from Medicaid reimbursements (mandatory spending) and grants authorized by Title X of the Public Health Service Act (discretionary spending).

Congress sets discretionary spending annually by passing twelve appropriations bills covering everything from national defense to education to transportation.

Mandatory spending funds entitlement programs -- notably Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. If you qualify for the programs, then you receive the money. There is no annual appropriation. Some Republicans in Congress incorrectly contend that mandatory spending is on ""autopilot"" and cannot be changed in appropriations bills. That's true for Medicare and Social Security, but not Medicaid. Medicaid is an ""appropriated entitlement"" which does not bypass the annual appropriations process: the level of Medicaid spending is determined by statute, but funding is provided through the annual appropriations bills. As CRS explains:

    The fact that Medicaid is subject to the annual appropriations process provides an opportunity for Congress to place funding limitations on specified activities in Medicaid, including the circumstances under which federal funds can be used to pay for abortions.

Medicaid is not on autopilot: Congress can and does direct and limit Medicaid funding through annual appropriations bills, including spending bills like the pending Omnibus. In fact, Congress has banned Medicaid funding for abortion by attaching the so-called Hyde Amendment to annual appropriations bills for forty years.

Title X grants are ""discretionary"" spending. Congress can use limitation provisions to restrict funding for specific purposes, even when the spending is authorized. The CRS report I requested confirmed: ""Limitations are allowable under the rules of the House and Senate under the principle that while Congress may authorize an activity, it is under no obligation to fund it.""

In the Federalist papers, James Madison described Congress's constitutional control over all federal spending -- the power over the purse -- as ""the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure."" It is clear that Congress can use the appropriations process to stop the flow of federal funding to Planned Parenthood and its affiliates by attaching a simple provision to the Omnibus.

The question is: why won't Republicans in Congress use the power over the purse -- this ""most complete and effectual weapon"" -- to defund America's number one abortion provider and trafficker of baby parts? The unfortunate answer is that they are unwilling to face down Senate Democrats and President Obama, who will block or veto any Omnibus with defunding language attached. Obama and the Democrats are willing to shut down the government to keep taxpayer money flowing into Planned Parenthood.

Republicans should remember that we have the majority in both chambers. It's time for Republicans to exercise the power of the purse, defund Planned Parenthood, and let Harry Reid and President Obama tell the American people they are willing to shut down the government to compel our constituents to pay for an abortion mill.",,,07/07/16 11:02 AM
155930,1104978,The Huffington Post - The Way Forward In Reentry,07/06/16,9,"By Loretta Lynch, Co-authored by Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council Cecilia Muñoz

As law enforcement agencies and community organizations team up across the country to reduce crime, expand opportunity, and revitalize our neighborhoods, it is increasingly clear that a crucial part of that work is helping people returning from our prisons and jails make a successful transition back to their families and communities. With more than 600,000 individuals leaving state and federal prisons each year and more than 11 million cycling through local jails, reentry is a process with enormous implications for communities across the United States and for all of us who care about making sure that we create opportunity for everyone who is able to contribute. If handled the right way, reentry policy can lead to lower crime, stronger families, and more prosperous communities. If handled poorly - or if ignored altogether - a failure to ensure successful reentry can deepen the cycles of poverty, criminality and incarceration that prevent too many of our neighborhoods from reaching their full potential.

This administration has been dedicated to improving reentry outcomes since President Obama took office in 2009. In the years since, the White House, the Department of Justice and agencies across the federal government have worked tirelessly to strengthen our reentry infrastructure in a number of ways. For example, the president's criminal justice reform agenda includes a number of reentry initiatives, some of which were highlighted in the department's National Reentry Week in April. And the Departments of Justice and Labor are funding innovative projects that support hundreds of adult and youth reentry programs across the country.

To build on these efforts, President Obama recently signed a memorandum formally establishing the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, which we are proud to chair together. The President's action officially charters an effort that started in January of 2011, when former Attorney General Eric Holder convened federal agency heads to address reentry in a more comprehensive fashion. The distance we have come in those five-and-a-half years is remarkable. We have opened doors to employment for returning citizens by launching the White House Fair Chance Business Pledge, an effort aimed at eliminating barriers to reentry and employment, including ""ban the box"" initiatives that delay questions about criminal history until an appropriate point in the hiring process. We have expanded access to educational opportunities through programs like Second Chance Pell, which makes some federal inmates eligible for college funding. And we are working to reduce the thousands of secondary consequences triggered by a criminal record - from trouble getting student loans to barriers to voting - restrictions that too often penalize those who have been in prison long after they have served their sentences.

Yesterday, we held the first meeting of the newly-chartered Reentry Council, and we took even more promising steps forward. Led by the council's Executive Director Amy Solomon, we discussed a number of recent accomplishments, evaluated ongoing activities and discussed a promising way forward. The White House gave an overview of the Fair Chance Business Pledge and the Higher Education Pledge, which enlists private-sector organizations and colleges and universities in providing individuals a fair chance to participate in the American economy. The Office of Personnel Management discussed how their new proposed rule will ""ban the box"" for federal hires, delaying inquiries about an applicant's criminal history until a conditional offer is made. The Department of Education described its Beyond the Box initiative to give justice-involved individuals access to postsecondary educational opportunities. The Department of Health and Human Services highlighted new guidance that extends Medicaid coverage to residents of community halfway houses, which will help as many as 100,000 people. And the Department of Justice showcased the Bureau of Prisons' Roadmap to Reentry, a strategic blueprint for reentry planning in the federal prison system released in the spring. The department also highlighted new guidelines soon to be published in the Federal Register that will give people who are incarcerated, often victims of crime and trauma themselves, access to federally-funded victim services.

In his memorandum, President Obama wrote that ""America is a nation of second chances."" But for too many Americans involved with the justice system, those second chances never appear. That's a status quo we cannot afford to accept. It is too damaging to those leaving prison; too harmful to the families and communities to which they're returning; and too costly to the nation, which depends upon the skills and talents of all its people. With the creation of the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, and the help of our dedicated partners throughout the United States, we're beginning to change that status quo, to create more second chances and to build a brighter future for all.",,,07/07/16 11:18 AM
26890,1105058,Democrats Took a Stand Thorugh the Powerful Act of Sitting Down,06/24/16,9,"By Rep. Steny Hoyer

Rep. John Lewis understands better than anyone that sometimes the best way to stand up for something is to sit down.  As a student leader during the Civil Rights Movement, he participated in lunch counter sit-ins to demand that his country recognize his basic right to eat.  In Selma, when his march for the right to vote was met with a sea of armed state troopers, he dropped to his knees in prayer -- he would not be moved except by force.  When John asked his House Democratic colleagues to join him for a sit-in on the House Floor on Wednesday morning, we knew it was time to take a stand, and we would do it by the powerful act of sitting down. 

We sat on the House Floor not to shut it down but to open it up.  By refusing to allow votes even on measures with broad, bipartisan support that would prevent unnecessary killings by gun violence, it was the Republican Majority, supported by the NRA, that had truly shut down the Floor.  Just days earlier, the attack in Orlando showed Americans once again how easy it is to obtain military-style assault weapons.  Under investigation for terrorism and can't get on a plane?  No problem -- buy a gun.  Don't like a certain ethnic or religious group and have a history of violence?  No need for a background check.  Have a criminal history of domestic violence?  Nothing to stop you from purchasing a gun.

According to the Brady Campaign, on average, 108,000 Americans are shot each year, and 32,500 of them are killed. In some of our cities, an epidemic of gun violence has spread like a virus.  Since the beginning of the year more than 1,300 people have been gunned down on the streets of Chicago, a 50% increase over 2015.  To hear Rep. Robin Kelly speak about the impact on the communities she represents is heartbreaking.  So too when I listen to Reps. John Larson and Elizabeth Esty share the pain of the Newtown families in Connecticut.  Along with Rep. Katherine Clark and Rep. David Cicilline, Reps. Kelly and Larson joined Rep. Lewis in leading our sit-in.  Democratic Members of Congress from all across the country have constituents who are suffering similar heartbreak, and we all sat together in solidarity, honoring the victims and their families.   

Our nation has fallen into a pattern of grief and inaction.  Whenever a mass murder occurs, whether against worshippers at a church, schoolchildren in their classrooms, moviegoers in a theater, or young people in a nightclub, we pray for the victims and their families.  We hold moments of silence -- in fact, Congress has held more than twenty-five moments of silence for mass shootings since Newtown.  But whenever Democrats have asked Republicans, who control Congress, to allow votes on even the most commonsense, bipartisan reforms to make our communities safer from guns, their answer is always the same: silence and inaction. 

After the carnage in Orlando, it became clearer than ever that prayers and moments of silence are not enough.  Even after Senate Republicans agreed, under pressure, to hold votes on gun safety bills and began negotiating on a bipartisan measure to keep those on the ""no fly"" list from buying dangerous firearms, House Republicans continued their silence and their obstruction.  Democrats had no choice but to take dramatic action to ensure that the issue of gun safety could not be ignored.  So we sat down.  We took turns sharing the stories of loved ones or constituents who had died from gun violence.  We sang the spirituals that sustained John and his compatriots in the Civil Rights Movement.  And we held up the names of those we've lost, ensuring they are not forgotten.

Still unwilling to allow a vote to save lives and keep guns out of the hands of terror suspects and those who shouldn't have them, Republicans simply adjourned the House on Wednesday night -- two days early -- and went home.  We may not yet have won the fight to secure a vote, but we achieved a major victory in our twenty-six hour sit-in.  We made it impossible for Republicans to ignore the issue of gun violence any longer.  We put them on notice -- on behalf of the overwhelming majorities of Democrats, Republicans, and independents that support commonsense reforms -- that moments of silence alone are not enough. 

Congress has a responsibility to keep the American people safe.  Right now, the Republican-led Congress is failing dismally to meet that basic duty.  As long as they continue to do so, House Democrats will keep doing whatever it takes to end the gridlock and demand real action to end the scourge of gun violence that is plaguing our nation.",,,07/07/16 11:47 AM

It covers some diverse areas, from populations centers such as Enid, Ponca City, Stillwater and parts of the Oklahoma City metro area, to the wide open spaces of Northwest Oklahoma.

Since 1994, the seat in the U.S. House has been occupied by Cheyenne farmer and rancher Frank Lucas.

In Tuesday's primary election, Lucas faces a Republican challenger, Hennessey resident Desiree Brown, for his party's nomination.

The winner will face Democrat Frankie Robbins, of Medford, in the November general election.

Brown has no political experience, but she is running because she says Lucas is not representing the values of Oklahoma.

Brown says she is a ""staunch constitutionalist,"" is pro-Second Amendment and is for states' rights.

She hopes to have a more limited government, with taxes and federal spending cut. We commend her for putting herself out there as a candidate.

For his part, Lucas has promised to do more of what he's done for the past 22 years, which is represent the people of his district as best he can.

As we said, the 3rd Congressional District is a diverse one. It's a tough one to manage, but in our opinion Frank Lucas has done a good job at it.

Agriculture and energy are big parts of the district, and Lucas, who is senior member of Oklahoma's congressional delegation, has proven to be a leader in both areas.

He's also stood strong on defense and helped improve the position of Vance Air Force Base.

Given the uncertainty facing our country, we need proven leadership in Congress. Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton will become the president, so that need for legislative leadership is even more pronounced.

46034,1105104,Consequences of Obama are Glaring,02/02/16,9,"By Tom Cole
After seven long years, the damaging consequences of President Obama's liberal agenda and policies become even more glaring by the day. Instead of confronting the serious challenges that desperately needed his attention, leadership and willingness to work with the legislative branch after he took the oath of office, the president has chosen throughout the entirety of his administration to ignore some of the most pressing issues facing the American people.

As a result of his misguided priorities, President Obama has greatly complicated the solutions required to get the country back on track.

One of the issues that has been mishandled by President Obama is the nation's massive debt and the dangerous rate at which it continues to grow. Despite claims to the contrary, the president has consistently shown that he is more interested in advancing policies (like Obamacare) that add to the debt -- instead of coming up with reforms to pay it down and slow the rate at which it is growing. He's even taken credit for shrinking deficits, resulting from Republican-led reforms to cut discretionary spending. However, the days of declining deficits are numbered. 

It is important to keep in mind that ""deficit"" is not the same as ""debt."" While the terms are closely related, the annual deficit accounts for the difference between that year's revenues and expenses. When the nation runs a deficit, it means that expenses are greater than the revenues available to cover those expenses. While smaller deficits mean less is added to our total debt, a deficit of any size still means more debt since the nation's total debt is equal to deficits accumulated year after year.

Last month, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its economic outlook for the next 10 years. If current policies are unchanged, CBO projected that national debt would reach $23.8 trillion by 2026. But more immediately this year, CBO revealed that, for the first time since 2009, the deficit will rise. This upturn is due to higher interest payments on our growing debt and a rise in entitlement spending -- for Social Security and Medicare programs -- with the first wave of the ""baby boomer"" generation currently beginning to retire.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, baby boomers are defined as individuals between the ages of 51 and 70 in 2016, so unless changes are made to entitlement programs, our deficits and our debt will continue to rise at an unsustainable rate.

Based on the expected year-end deficit for 2016, CBO further projected that total debt held by the public will reach 76 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), which is ""higher than it has been since the years immediately following World War II.""

A troubling frame of reference from 2008, this same statistic was dramatically lower with total debt equal to approximately 39 percent of GDP.

Even more recently, the Bureau of Economic Analysis added to the chorus of disappointing economic reports just last week. Its analysis of GDP during the fourth quarter of 2015 revealed that the U.S. economy grew by less than one percent -- a noticeable and unexpected decline from the previous quarter.

While there are plenty of contributing factors for this lackluster growth, I believe that it reflects the declining confidence of Americans in their economic future and their concern over the president's unwillingness to recommend lasting reforms.

Despite the president's failure to confront the real drivers of our debt, I remain confident that responsible, conservative leaders in Congress will continue to lead by proposing solutions for balancing the budget and paying down the debt. Until we make the tough decisions about entitlement spending and implement lasting reforms, our country will continue to drown in debt and our economic recovery will be halting and lackluster.",,,07/07/16 12:06 PM
15375,1105140,Allow the FBI to Track Terrorists Online,07/06/16,9,"By Senator John Cornyn

A little longer than a year ago, two Islamic State-inspired terrorists, clad in body armor and armed with assault rifles and 1,500 rounds of ammunition, drove up to the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland to kill as many people as possible. Fortunately, law enforcement immediately took action and the terrorists were killed before they could step foot inside and open fire on the estimated 150 people there.

Dallas, and our state, avoided what could have been a real tragedy that day. But in the months since then, we've seen more and more cases of people becoming self-radicalized here in the United States. Omar Mateen, the Orlando terrorist, serves as the most recent example of an American citizen turned extremist.

In today's interconnected world, terrorists abroad don't have to come to the United States to wreak havoc. Videos, tweets and social media posts quickly become the gasoline that can fuel Americans to radicalize and carry out deadly attacks. In other words, the battle is being waged at home and over the internet just as it is being waged in places like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

The rise of home-grown terrorism, and the massive online terrorist networks that facilitate it, poses a clear and present danger to the United States. Law enforcement officers don't have speedy access to critical pieces of information they need to identify, investigate and prosecute terrorists here at home. And because of that, they're not able to collect the dots to connect the dots to investigate and lock up suspected terrorists.

Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has the authority to get the financial and telephone records of suspected terrorists using a subpoena called a national security letter. But because of a drafting error in the law, the FBI can't readily access the same information on these new techniques the Islamic State uses to recruit and radicalize violent extremists online. The bottom line is that our law enforcement officials lack the modern tools they need to address the evolving threats we face.

An amendment to a government funding bill I recently supported would correct this error and give the FBI the ability to collect and analyze the records of potential terrorists' electronic communications. Put another way, the legislation would help the FBI track down terrorists, and it would do so without infringing on the privacy or rights of Americans.

This amendment would not grant the government access to the content of Americans' online activity. It would simply give investigators a chance to review the internet metadata of suspected terrorists, like who they talked to and where they went online. Law enforcement would still need a search warrant from a judge to learn the contents of a message.

The measure has broad bipartisan support in the Senate. James Comey, the director of the FBI, has called it a top legislative priority. President Barack Obama supports it too and wants this legislation passed. In other words, this is a bipartisan priority that has united a lot of people who usually hold very different views.

The foiled attack in Garland serves as an example of homegrown terrorists thwarted in their mission to attack our communities. We don't know what the FBI would have discovered about the terrorists in Orlando or San Bernardino if they had this authority. But we should do all we can to help our public servants collect what they need to do their jobs, defend our homeland and better guard against future terrorist attacks.",,,07/07/16 12:18 PM
8168,1105166,Op-Ed Susan Davis: Let's Not Have Another Tragedy Pass By Without Action,06/17/16,9,"Pride Month is a time to celebrate our progress and to recommit toward total equality today.

With the shooting deaths of 49 people at a popular gay nightclub in Orlando, this year's Pride activities will take a somber tone.

This deadliest mass shooting in the history of our country brought senseless sorrow and loss to the victims and their loved ones. The world expressed its grief and support for the LGBT community and the community of Orlando.

In a familiar refrain: We are all Orlando.

The shootings join a list of attacks on the LGBT community throughout our history -- Stonewall, the arson of the Upstairs Lounge in New Orleans that killed 32, the assassination of Harvey Milk, and the murder of Matthew Shepard.

Orlando underscores the climate the LGBT community still faces on a daily basis. According to the FBI, 20% of hate crimes are LGBT motivated. This is second only to hate crimes based on race.

These incidents of violence are attempts to instill fear, intimidate, and weaken the resolve in the quest for equality. But in the end, they always have the opposite effect.

I am inspired by the ability of LGBT Americans to rise up in the face of these horrific events and continue the fight for equality, inclusiveness, and opportunity. We owe it to the victims of Orlando and the victims of past acts of violence to work toward an even better world for future generations.

The outrage I feel, as a member of Congress, when these mass shootings occur is that nothing ever changes. Republican Leadership in Congress simply refuses to let us have a debate on the issue of gun violence, let alone pass significant laws that will protect the American people.

People are demanding action and Congress should respond. Here's what I'd like to see enacted:

We know that the Orlando shooter was on the terror watch list. Democrats are reviving past legislative efforts to keep those on the terror watch list from buying guns. If you can't fly then you shouldn't be able to buy.

The AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifle is becoming the weapon of choice for mass murderers. It was used in Orlando, Newtown, and San Bernardino. Why do we continue to allow easy access to these assault weapons where the sole purpose is to kill as many people as possible?

Listen to the audio of the amount of shots fired at the nightclub. If that doesn't convince anyone we need to reinstate the assault weapons ban then I don't know what will.

Glaring loopholes in our nation's system of background checks need to be closed. There is bipartisan legislation in the House that would extend background checks requirements to gun shows and purchases over the Internet.

Our nation's laws still don't adequately protect the rights of LGBT Americans.

The Equality Act would add sexual orientation to the list of protections under our nation's civil rights laws. This will give LGBT Americans greater protection under the law and provide critical legal recourse to fight discrimination.

The Student Non-Discrimination Act will confront discrimination in our schools and will instill the notion of equality at an early age. It ensures all students, regardless of sexual orientation, have equal access to all school activities. It declares that harassment is discrimination.

How we respond to these moments defines who we are as a nation.  Let's renew our commitment to diversity and equality. Let's come together to create a future where everyone can live, love, and never have to live in fear for who they are.",,,07/07/16 12:29 PM
