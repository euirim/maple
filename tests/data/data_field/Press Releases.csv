1105346,41567,North Carolina Welcomes Largest Ever Containership to Port of Wilmington,07/05/16,4,"Supporting Governor Pat McCrory's efforts to increase trade and promote economic growth at our state ports, North Carolina officials welcomed the largest containership to visit the Port of Wilmington. The Hanjin Baltimore, measuring 984 feet in length and 140 feet in width, is the first of many post-Panamax vessels to be served at the recently updated container port in North Carolina.
 
""Our state ports are an important asset for creating jobs and connecting North Carolinians to opportunities around the world,"" said Governor McCrory. ""This important milestone shows our commitment to supporting our ports and overall economy is paying off and keeping North Carolina globally competitive.""
 
The expansion of the North Carolina ports is a key part of Governor McCrory's 25-year Vision for North Carolina. That includes providing access for the Panamax vessels, expanding access to the ports inland by developing intermodal train service at the Port of Wilmington, and pursuing opportunities to develop intermodal facilities along the I-95 corridor to improve the movement of goods through North Carolina and along the East Coast.
 
""This is an important day for our Ports and for the State of North Carolina,"" said Executive Director Paul J. Cozza. ""We've been working diligently on modernizing our ports and to see our plans come to fruition by proving that the Port of Wilmington is big ship ready is a great feeling.""
 
Built in 2005 by Hyundai Heavy Industries, the Hanjin Baltimore has served various Far East trade lanes in its tenure. Holding 7,500 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), which are containers 20 feet long and eight feet tall, the vessel is approximately 63 percent larger than any ship that has ever visited the Port of Wilmington.
 
""This vessel not only signifies improving global trade but it also represents the future,"" said Chief Commercial Officer Greg Fennell. ""If there was ever a doubt that we could not accept a post-Panamax vessel, this ship puts that debate to rest.""
 
Recent infrastructure advancements allow North Carolina's Ports to improve upon its operational efficiencies, to keep cargo moving and to remain congestion free. The Port of Wilmington will be prepared to handle even larger post-Panamax vessels, up to the 10,000 TEU class, by later this summer.
 
""This landmark event is the product of a North Carolina Ports infrastructure investment plan to meet shipping industry requirements,"" said Tom Adams, Chairman of the Board of Directors. ""With the expansion of the Panama Canal taking place last weekend, the Port of Wilmington is adding new cranes, an enhanced berth, a wider turning basin and will have further expansion in the future.""
 
North Carolina's Ports in Wilmington and Morehead City, plus inland terminals in Charlotte and Greensboro, link the state's consumers, businesses and industry to world markets, and serve as magnets to attract new business and industry while receiving no direct taxpayer subsidy. Port activities contribute statewide to 76,000 jobs and $700 million each year in state and local tax revenues.",,,07/07/16 02:46 PM
1105348,41560,"Ross To Talk Importance of Protecting Social Security, Medicare",07/07/16,4,"Deborah Ross, Democratic nominee for US Senate, spoke in Greensboro today about how she will work to protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare. These discussions are part of a larger statewide tour where Deborah will discuss retirement security.

""I've met people who have worked hard their whole lives, but are putting off retirement because they don't know if they or their families can afford it. They don't know if Social Security will get cut or Medicare will get privatized, and they don't have the money to take that gamble,"" said Deborah. ""Not only is Washington not helping, but politicians like Richard Burr are making matters worse. He voted to cut Social Security and took more than $1 million from insurance companies, while writing a plan to privatize Medicare and raise the retirement age. That may be good for the insurance companies' profits, but it will force seniors to pay more. When I say I'll protect these benefits, North Carolina can count on me to keep my word.""

When it comes to Social Security and Medicare, Richard Burr has spent his 20-plus years in Congress looking out for himself and special interests, but not the working people who elected him. Burr voted to cut Social Security and took more than $1 million from insurance companies while also writing a plan to privatize Medicare and raise the retirement age.

    Burr supported reducing Social Security payments and voted against protecting Social Security from benefit cuts or privatization.
    Burr not only voted against preventing Medicare from being privatized or turned into a voucher program, he proposed his own plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program and raise the eligibility age to receive benefits. His plan would help insurance companies profit while shifting Medicare costs onto beneficiaries.

Deborah knows that America's seniors have earned their Social Security and Medicare benefits through a lifetime of hard work. She will work to protect and strengthen them -- not privatize or end them -- so today's seniors and today's workers can enjoy the financial security they've earned. As Senator, she will work to:

    Make sure our country's wealthiest Americans pay their fair share into Social Security
    Make it easier for more employers to sponsor retirement plans
    Control the cost of Medicare by making sure seniors pay for quality, not quantity
    Crackdown on inefficiencies, errors, and those trying to abuse the Medicare program
    Engage consumers with information to make efficient and effective healthcare decisions
    Make prescription drugs more affordable

During this series of policy discussions with voters, Deborah will discuss her plans to protect Social Security and Medicare and talk about the importance to standing up to big money and special interests who profit off these programs while forcing people to pay more.

 

Background

Burr on Social Security

    Burr Voted Against Protecting Social Security From Benefit Cuts Or Privatization. In March 2015, Burr voted against a: ""Wyden, D-Ore., motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the Enzi, R-Wyo., point of order against the Wyden amendment no. 471 for not being germane. The Wyden amendment would create a 60-vote point of order against any legislation that would reduce Social Security benefits, increase the retirement age for benefits or privatize Social Security."" The motion was rejected 51-48. [CQ, 3/24/15, S.Amdt. 471 to S.Con.Res. 11, Vote 84,3/24/15]
    Burr Supported Reducing Social Security Payments. ""There is a deep need in the long term for change so it is fiscally sound and sustainable for future generations,' Burr said. That might include determining whether to reduce the size of the payments ""to reflect what's available in the reserves,' he said."" [Winston-Salem Journal, 4/19/11]

Burr on Medicare

BURR TOOK OVER $1 MILLION FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES

    Burr Has Received $1.1 Million From Insurance Interests.Over the course of his political career Burr has received a total of $1,129,864 from insurance industry interests. [opensecrets.org, accessed June 1, 2016]

BURR INTRODUCED A PLAN TO REFORM MEDICARE WHICH WOULD TURN IT INTO VOUCHERS AND RAISE THE ELIGIBILITY AGE

    2012: Burr Unveiled His Own Medicare Voucher Plan, Similar To The Ryan Plan. ""Two Republican senators unveiled a Medicare overhaul Thursday that features an accelerated transition to private health insurance for many seniors, a gradual increase in the eligibility age, and higher premiums for middle-class and upper-income retirees. [Â…] Like Ryan, Coburn and Burr would gradually raise the eligibility age to 67. But their plan also differs in several important ways. It would start the transition to a system dominated by private insurance plans in 2016 instead of waiting a decade, as Ryan has proposed. Private plans would compete with a government-sponsored program, a retooled version of today's Medicare. Seniors would get a fixed amount from the government which they could apply toward a private plan or the government plan modeled on Medicare. Benefits would not be spelled out, but all plans would have to meet a test of basic insurance value."" [Associated Press,2/16/12]
        Burr Proposed Turning Medicare Into Vouchers, Raising The Eligibility Age, And Increasing Premiums By 9 Percent. ""Republican U.S. Sens. Richard Burr of Winston-Salem and Tom Coburn on Thursday unveiled their plan for changing Medicare, the government-run health-care program for seniors.  The plan would offer seniors, starting in 2016, the choice to stick with the government-run fee-for-service program, or choose health insurance policies offered by private companies that would bid for the right to participate in the Medicare program.  According to Burr, the Seniors' Choice Act also would:  Provide a maximum out-of-pocket protection so that a senior would not have to pay more than $7,500 per year in medical expenses.  Gradually raise the age of eligibility for participating in Medicare by two months for each year until age 67, starting with people born in 1949.  Gradually increase the premiums on Medicare by an average of 3 percent each year beginning in 2013 so that a 9 percent increase is accomplished by 2016."" [Raleigh News & Observer, 2/18/12]
        Burr-Coburn Plan Increased Medicare Part B Premiums By 9 Percent Of Part A And B Program Costs Prior To Implementation Of Premium Support, And Beneficiaries Would Pay The Difference Between Their Defined Federal Contribution And Their Plan. ""Burr-Coburn ""Seniors' Choice Act' February 16, 2012 Part B premiums would be increased by 3 percent of Part A and B program costs each year, beginning in 2013, to achieve a 9 percent increase prior to implementation of premium support in 2016. Beneficiaries would pay the difference between the defined federal contribution and the bid for the plan in which they chose to enroll. Unclear how the Part B and Part D formulas would be calculated or applied beginning in 2016."" [Comparison Of Medicare Premium Support Proposals, Kaiser Family Foundation, 7/26/12]
    Burr's Proposal For Medicare Included An ""Increased Shift Toward More Privatization Of The Medicare Industry."" ""Under the legislative proposal put forward by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., seniors would be limited in how they use private supplemental Medicare insurance and maximum out-of-pocket medical expenses under Medicare Parts A and B would also be limited. The proposal would also increase out-of-pocket requirements for wealthy seniors. But perhaps the biggest change is a provision that would give seniors the right to choose the Medicare plan that best meets their needs. That means that in 2016, there would be an increased shift toward more privatization of the Medicare industry. Traditional Medicare fee-for-service plans and private plans would ""be forced to compete head-to-head,' Coburn said in a statement."" [A.M. Best, 2/21/12]

BURR'S PLAN WOULD HELP INSURANCE COMPANIES PROFIT

    Insurance Companies Are Prospering Through Expanding Their Roles In Government Health Care Programs. ""Despite the sluggish economy, the nation's major health insurers have prospered in large part by expanding their role in government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, according to a study released Thursday. The share of large insurers' revenues contributed by their Medicare and Medicaid business has jumped from 36 to 42 percent over the past three yearsÂ….During last year's first three quarters, the combined operating margin of the five largest publicly traded insurance companies averaged 8.65 percent -- the best three-quarter performance of the past three years. This occurred even as revenues from traditional private-insurance business have remained virtually flat since the end of 2008."" [Washington Post, 1/4/12]
    Private Plans Through Medicare Advantage Cost The Government 113 Percent More Than Traditional Medicare. A paper by the Kaiser Family Foundation stated that ""The government pays 113% more for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage than for beneficiaries in traditional MedicareÂ… While some have supported the expanded role of Medicare Advantage plans as a means to improve benefits and lower costs under Medicare, the role of private plans in Medicare has been called into question in part due to the fact that the government actually pays these plans more per enrollee than if they were in traditional FFS Medicare, according to analysis by government entities.""

Warner and Tim Kaine, and Representative Bobby Scott applauded unanimous House passage of a bipartisan bill that would recognize the resilience and contributions of African Americans to the United States since 1619. Kaine and Warner introduced the Senate version and Scott the House version of the 400 Years of African American History Commission Act in February. The bill would establish a commission to plan programs and activities across the country in 2019 to highlight the arrival and influence of Africans in America.  

Today's House-passed bill was introduced by Virginia Representative Bobby Scott, and cosponsored by Representatives Scott Rigell, Don Beyer, Gerry Connolly, Barbara Comstock, Rob Wittman, and Randy Forbes, as well as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Chairman G.K Butterfield and Congressman John Lewis.

The commission  would be charged with recognizing and the resilience and contribution of African Americans since 1619, as well as acknowledging the painful impact that slavery and laws that enforced racial discrimination have had on our nation's history. Similar commissions have been established to recognize English & Hispanic heritage, including the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, Virginia and the 450th anniversary of the founding of St. Augustine, Florida. Kaine testified in support of this bill in front of the a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee this month.

""This bill is so connected to our country's history and heritage, and we are excited that it is one step closer to final passage,"" Sen. Kaine said. ""Every dimension of American life, across generations, has been influenced by African Americans. We need to tell that story -- in its tragedy and triumph- as we approach the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first Africans at Point Comfort, Virginia. We will continue to work to advance this bill in the Senate in the coming months.""

""I applaud my colleagues in the House for passing this bill,"" said Rep. Scott.  ""The history of Virginia and our nation cannot be fully understood or appreciated without knowing about the first Africans who arrived at Point Comfort, Virginia in 1619.  The commission established by this bill will be charged with the important task of planning, developing and implementing a series of programs and activities throughout 2019 that fully tells the story of African Americans, their contributions to the fabric of our nation, and their resilience over the last 400 years.""

""We cannot move forward as a country unless we recognize the injustices that occurred in our past,"" said Sen. Warner. ""The creation of this commission is an opportunity to institutionalize the contributions made by African Americans in our country, and a monument to their resilience in the face of adversity. It is my hope that this legislation paves the way for future efforts to honor the important role African Americans have played in our history, and highlight ways we can work together to forge a path towards a better future.""

""Understanding our 400 years of African-American history is crucial to understanding our national story: what we got right, what we got horribly wrong, and what we still have to accomplish,"" said Rep. Beyer. ""This bill will help us grapple with that history, and I thank my friends Bobby Scott and Tim Kaine and my other Virginia colleagues for putting it forward.""

""As a student of history, I can't help but look to the lessons of the past when contemplating the future. In addition to being reminded of the ramifications of slavery in our nation, I can recall state constitutional provisions that led to segregation policies which extended into my childhood, when I attended segregated schools in the first and second grades. Additionally, one of my favorite teachers, my sixth grade teacher Mrs. Spurlock, had previously taught in the segregated system. I appreciate this bill's efforts to highlight the immeasurable influence of African Americans such as Mrs. Spurlock, and am honored to support the legislation,"" said Rep. Griffith.

""I am pleased the House passed this bipartisan, bicameral bill,"" said Rep. Rigell. ""The ""400 Years of African-American History Commission' will help our nation to properly reflect upon the significant contributions African-Americans have made to our country, and the struggles they have endured during our history. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to pass this important bill and send it to the President's desk for signature immediately.""

""I am pleased the House passed this legislation to create a commission that will tell the important story of the significant contributions made by African-Americans to our Commonwealth and the country.  We cannot tell the whole story of America without including the first African-Americans who arrived to the shores of Virginia in 1619 to Point Comfort.  I look forward to the work this commission will do in educating our entire community and hope the U.S. Senate will pass this quickly,"" said Rep. Comstock.

""This bipartisan legislation honors 400 years of African American contributions here in the U.S.,"" said Rep. Wittman. ""The men and women who first arrived in Point Comfort, Virginia in 1619 faced adversity of every kind and at every turn, and their perseverance carried them as they shaped our national heritage. Theirs are stories that deserve to be told, and the commission that this legislation will create provides necessary tools to make sure that future generations can benefit from learning about their vigilance. I want to thank my Virginia colleagues in both the House and Senate for their hard work on this bill, and I look forward to their continued support.""

""2019 will mark 400 years since the first documented arrival of Africans by way of Point Comfort, Virginia. It's time for our nation to commemorate the contributions and resilience African Americans have made throughout history. I am pleased to have been a part of the introduction of H.R. 4539, which, when passed, will establish a commission to highlight the influence and contributions African Americans have made in our country since 1619. It will also recognize the painful impact of slavery 400 years ago, as well as the racial discrimination and oppression that continues today. I congratulate Congressmen Bobby Scott and Don Beyer on House passage of H.R. 4539. I also thank U.S. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner for sponsoring the Senate companion, and Hilary Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau, for supporting this Act,"" said Rep. Butterfield.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) introduced a new measure that would protect Congress's role to define China's economy as market-based or non-market-based so as to retain tools retain tools to protect workers and businesses in Minnesota, Nebraska, and across the country by helping to keep China's unscrupulous trade practices in check.

China is currently classified as a ""non-market economy""--meaning that the government closely controls the economy, and prices don't accurately reflect their true values. And because China is classified as a non-market economy, the U.S. is able to take additional steps to more accurately impose anti-dumping duties for commodities like steel and timber.

Right now, China is pushing trade officials in the U.S. and abroad to grant it ""market economy"" status. Currently, this change can be done by the by the executive branch alone without a vote by the American people's representatives in Congress. If China's request is approved by the Administration, which could happen by the end of 2016, Americans could lose important trade protections.

The Senators' legislation proposes a simple, yet effective step to support fair trade practices: The U.S. Commerce Department could not use any taxpayer resources to unilaterally grant market-economy status to China. By doing that, American workers, communities, and industries would be protected from China's non-market economy.

""When it comes to producing iron ore and steel, Minnesota's Iron Rangers know that they can compete with anybody in the world on a level-playing field,"" said Sen. Franken. ""But when China manipulates its trade economy, it undercuts American producers and threatens our workers, communities, and industries. Granting China 'market economy' status would potentially harm regions like Northern Minnesota and would also make it more difficult to crack down on unfair trade practices. Our workers deserve better, which is why we need to pass this amendment to help us keep China's trade practices in check.""

""Current law provides tools for our country to check unfair practices by China,"" said Sen. Sasse. ""But current law allows these tools to be changed anytime by the President, unilaterally. This amendment will ensure that free trade benefits Americans and lets Congress decide if China has a functioning market. Democrats and Republicans should be able to come together to take this small step to restore the Constitutional balance between Congress and the President.""",,,07/07/16 02:49 PM

The company plans to invest $7.6 million at its Yadkinville facility over that time.
 
""Our strong infrastructure, convenient access to millions of North American consumers and competitive costs make North Carolina the ideal location for companies like B&G Foods,"" said Governor McCrory. ""B&G Foods produces some of the nation's most popular brands and is a prominent name in our food and beverage manufacturing industry.""
 
B&G Foods Snacks is a subsidiary of publicly-held B&G Foods, Inc. (NYSE: BGS), based in Parsippany, N.J.  The company manufactures and distributes a range of packaged food products across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Its popular brands include Green GiantÂ®, OrtegaÂ®, Mrs. DashÂ®, Cream of WheatÂ®, Pirate's BootyÂ® and many others.   In Yadkinville, B&G Foods Snacks manufactures New York StyleÂ® and Old LondonÂ® products and will integrate manufacturing of Mama Mary'sÂ® pizza crusts as part of this expansion. 
 
""North Carolina is the #1 state in the Southeast for manufacturing employment, and that includes the 62,000 workers who make our food and beverage manufacturing industry a global player,"" said Secretary Skvarla. ""North Carolina is a state where companies and people make things, and that includes good food.""
 
B&G Foods Snacks has operated its Yadkinville facility since 2012. The company currently employs 172 locally, before this expansion. The new jobs will add nearly $1.6 million to B&G Foods Snacks' annual payroll in Yadkinville.

One NC Fund provides financial assistance, through local governments, to attract business projects that will stimulate economic activity and create new jobs in the state. Companies receive no money up front and must meet job creation and investment performance standards to qualify for grant funds. One NC grants also require and are contingent on financial matches from local governments.

The policy will be phased in during a one-year period. Effective immediately, service members may no longer be involuntarily separated, discharged or denied reenlistment solely on the basis of gender identity. Service members currently on duty will be able to serve openly.
 
Not later than October 1, 2016, DoD will create and distribute a commanders' training handbook, medical protocol and guidance for changing a service member's gender in the Defense Eligibility Enrollment System (DEERS). At this point, the services will be required to provide medically necessary care and treatment to transgender service members according to the medical protocol and guidance, and may begin changing gender markers in DEERS.  Prior to October 1, 2016, requests for medical treatment will be handled on a case-by-case basis consistent with the spirit of the Directive Type Memorandum and the DoD Instruction issued today.
 
Over the course of the next year, the Department will finalize force training plans and implementation guidance, revise regulations and forms, and train the force, including commanders, human resources specialists, recruiters and service members.  Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Peter Levine will work with the military services to monitor and oversee this effort.
 
At one year, the services will begin allowing transgender individuals to join the armed forces, assuming they meet accession standards.  In addition, an otherwise-qualified individual's gender identity will not be considered a bar to admission to a military service academy, or participation in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps or any other accession program if the individual meets the new criteria.  

The full policy must be completely implemented no later than July 1, 2017.
 
To support service members, medical professionals and commanders during the implementation period, the DoD has set up a central coordination cell which will serve as a central point of contact for technical questions and concerns.  The coordination cell is made up of legal experts, policy experts and medical professionals familiar with the issue.",,,07/07/16 02:56 PM
1105382,108924,Sen. Franken: My Bipartisan Measure Will Help Give Foster Kids in Minnesota More Stability,06/23/16,4,"Today, key federal agencies are helping states implement a bipartisan measure written by U.S. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) that was passed into last year's law overhauling No Child Left Behind.

Very often, foster kids are forced to move from school to school when they change foster homes, which can be very disruptive to a child's emotional, academic, and intellectual development. Sen. Franken's measure makes sure that states, schools districts, and child welfare agencies give foster kids the best possible educational experience by keeping them in the same schools when it makes sense. And today, the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services jointly released guidance on how his measure can be implemented.

""Foster kids sometimes change homes and schools a dozen times--or even more--throughout their childhood,"" said Sen. Franken. ""And in the past, if new foster parents lived in a different school district, the student had to change schools. But for a lot of these kids, school is where they feel safe, secure, and are able to find certainty. I wrote a measure into the new education bill to address this, and I'm pleased that key federal agencies are going to help states like Minnesota implement this provision.""

Sen. Franken, a member of the Senate Education Committee, played a key role in last year's overhaul of No Child Left Behind. Sen. Franken has also been pressing the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services to quickly provide guidance so foster children across the country can get the high-quality education they deserve.",,,07/07/16 02:57 PM
1105384,535,"Sens. Warner, Kaine Co-Sponsor Bill to Address Humanitarian and Migrant Crisis in Central America's Northern Triangle",07/07/16,4,"Today, U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) announced their support for legislation to establish a coordinated regional response to effectively address the endemic violence and humanitarian crisis driving women and children to flee from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The Secure the Northern Triangle Act calls for increased refugee processing in the region, and orderly and humane processing of individuals who reach the U.S.-Mexico border seeking protection. It also cracks down on smugglers, cartels and traffickers exploiting children and families, and pushes local governments to adopt political and anti-corruption reforms in order to address the root causes of regional violence and instability.

""While our priority continues to be the safety of our borders, it is important that we use every tool available to help stop the violence in the Northern Triangle region, and prevent more lives from being senselessly lost at our southern border,"" said Sen. Warner. ""Our country has a proud history of responding to humanitarian crises, and this plan keeps that spirit while helping stabilize the region, improving our security through a fair and orderly refugee process both at home and abroad, and establishing a way for families to safely stay in their own countries or in neighboring countries. The lives of vulnerable women and children are at stake.""

""Unprecedented levels of violence, dire poverty and endemic corruption in Central America has spurred thousands to flee their home countries -- mainly Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador --  in search of a better life,"" said Sen. Kaine. ""The United States can no longer ignore the obligation to address the challenges posed by this increase in refugees at our southern border. I believe this comprehensive bill is important to the national security of American citizens, the security of children and families in the Northern Triangle, and will bolster our efforts to stabilize a volatile and dangerous region in our own hemisphere.  This includes holding the Northern Triangle countries accountable for required economic and political reforms to stem the high levels of migration.""

Specifically, this bill would:

    Condition foreign aid to Central American governments on successful reform efforts to address the root causes of violence and instability that are driving migration;
    Crack down on smugglers and traffickers exploiting vulnerable children and families;
    Minimize border crossings by expanding refugee protections, processing, and housing in the region;
    Enhance monitoring of unaccompanied children after they are processed at the border; and
    Ensure fair and orderly processing of those who do reach our border seeking protection.

Central America's Northern Triangle region -- El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala -- has seen staggering increases in organized crime, gang violence, and poverty. The Northern Triangle has some of the highest murder rates of women and children in the world -- higher even than once-active war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, from 2010 to 2013, 95 percent of murders in the Northern Triangle were unsolved or unprosecuted. As conditions in these countries have deteriorated, many residents have been forced to flee. While the number of unaccompanied children and families arriving at the border has been increasing dramatically since 2011, the number of children coming from the Northern Triangle spiked dramatically in the summer of 2014, leading to the so-called unaccompanied children ""crisis."" The Secure the Northern Triangle Act takes on this challenge by addressing head-on the underlying political, economic, and social unrest in these countries that has resulted in continued migration.",,,07/07/16 03:00 PM
1105391,8315,"On National Security, Congress is Missing in Action",06/15/16,4,"As the Pentagon's annual spending bill moves to the House floor, Congresswoman Lee will be offering and supporting several amendments to enhance national security, promote human rights and restore Congressional oversight to our nation's unchecked war-making power.

""Once again, Congress is preparing to double down on the abdication of our Constitutional responsibility to oversee our nation's wars and national security,"" said Congresswoman Lee. ""Simply too much is at stake for Congress to quietly pass the buck on our national security.""

Congresswoman Lee will offer a bipartisan amendment to force a Congressional debate on an updated war authorization (AUMF). Her amendment would restrict funding for the 2001 AUMF that was passed for the specific purpose of dismantling al-Qaeda following the horrific events of September 11th, 2001. The amendment language provides Congress with sufficient time to draft, debate and vote on an updated and specific AUMF.

""More than fourteen years ago, Congress wrote a blank check for endless war to any President. This AUMF has since been used as the unclassified justification for at least 37 military operations in 14 countries,"" said Congresswoman Lee.  ""My amendment  would force Congress to do its job by providing ample time to draft and debate an updated AUMF. Our brave men and women in uniform deserve a Congress with the courage to debate the cost and consequences of the war, which they are being asked to fight.""

Congresswoman Lee offered a similar amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) earlier this year. ""I will continue to find and utilize every opportunity to force this debate. Our brave servicemen and women simply deserve better and the Constitution requires it.""

Additionally, Congresswoman Lee is co-sponsoring the bipartisan McGovern-Jones-Lee amendment to restrict funding for Iraq and Syria operations until Congress passes an updated AUMF. She is also supporting a bipartisan amendment by Congressman Ted Yoho to prevent the unauthorized expansion of war into Libya.

""I cannot allow another servicemember to leave their family and fight a war that Congress cannot even muster the courage to debate,"" added Congresswoman Lee.

Together with Congressman Jared Polis, Congresswoman Lee is also working to rein in outrageous Pentagon spending. Today, the Pentagon consumes more than half a trillion dollars, half of the annual federal discretionary budget. The Polis-Lee amendment would reduce accounts by one percent excluding accounts that directly support servicemembers and their families including personnel and Defense Health Program account.

""For decades, military experts have cautioned Congress that unchecked spending, especially at the Pentagon, is ballooning our national debt and endangering our nation's security,"" said Congresswoman Lee. ""In the 21st century, we need a smart, strategic national defense strategy. We can no longer afford ""pet project' weapons systems that are unnecessary or the Pentagon's unchecked levels of waste, fraud and abuse.""

Earlier this year, the House adopted the Burgess-Lee amendment to the NDAA, which mandates reporting on the audit-readiness of Pentagon accounts.

She is also co-sponsoring an amendment by Congressman Conyers to prevent the transfer of cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia.

""Cluster munitions are outdated and simply cruel. They are indiscriminate killers, serve no useful purpose and must be discontinued,"" added Congresswoman Lee.

Finally, Congresswoman Lee will be supporting the bipartisan Massie-Lofgren amendment to cut off funding for warrantless wiretaps and unjustified searches of the communications of American citizens.",,,07/07/16 03:04 PM
1105392,26991,Slaughter Statement on the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report,06/30/16,4,"Congresswoman Louise M. Slaughter (NY-25) today released the following statement on the release of the State Department's 2016 Trafficking in Persons report:

""It is disheartening that the State Department has once again put political expedience above the victims of human trafficking,"" said Rep. Slaughter. ""Last year, the administration upgraded Malaysia, not based on any progress that country made in addressing this serious problem, but because they wanted to jam the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal through Congress using special fast track rules. Since then, more graves of trafficking victims have been uncovered and there is little reason to believe that Malaysia's corrupt government will act to remedy its trafficking crisis. It is bad enough that the administration wants to pass the misguided TPP that will hurt American workers, but now it wants to sweep under the rug the fact that one of the proposed trading partners is a haven for human rights abuses and modern day slavery.""

The State Department issues an annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, rating all countries in one of three categories according to their efforts to address human trafficking. The 2014 TIP report rated Malaysia as Tier 3, the worst category, based on its record as a destination and source for sex trafficking and forced labor.

Under the Trade Promotion Authority bill Congress passed in June 2015, trade agreements that include Tier 3 countries were prohibited from receiving expedited consideration using fast track procedures. Malaysia is one of 12 countries that are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Despite a consistent failure to meet minimum standards to prevent human trafficking, Malaysia was upgraded to Tier 2 in the 2015 TIP report released in July 2015. Reports indicated that senior political staff at State had overruled their own trafficking experts' assessment that Malaysia should remain at Tier 3.

In June 2015, Rep. Slaughter joined with a bipartisan group of 160 House members in asking Secretary Kerry to keep Malaysia in Tier 3, and she was one of 127 members who cosponsored H.Con.Res 65, which expressed the sense of Congress that Malaysia should have remained in Tier 3. In September 2015, Rep. Slaughter joined with colleagues to request that the State Department Office of Inspector General investigate the circumstances surrounding Malaysia's TIP upgrade.",,,07/07/16 03:05 PM
1105395,8315,Congresswoman Lee Mourns Orlando Tragedy,06/12/16,4,"Congresswoman Barbara Lee released this statement following the tragedy in Orlando:

""Today, our nation awoke to horrific news. The attack against Pulse nightclub is an attack on the LGBT community, the city of Orlando, and our country.  The senseless violence is undoubtedly an act of hatred and terrorism. 

My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those lost and I pray for a speedy recovery for those injured. Quite simply the senselessness of this tragedy defies explanation.

This tragedy should call our nation&#8206; to greater action to prevent dangerous individuals from obtaining and using firearms.

Despite repeated Democratic efforts to close a glaring loophole that allows individuals on the Homeland Security Department's No Fly List&#8206; to purchase weapons, Republicans have blocked this common sense fix at every turn.

As Members&#8206; of Congress, we have responsibility to act to prevent dangerous individuals from obtaining weapons, including assault-style weapons.

1105398,8315,Expanded U.S. Role in Afghanistan Shows Nation's Longest War Is Far From Over,06/10/16,4,"Today, Congresswoman Barbara Lee released this statement following news that U.S. troops in Afghanistan would become further engaged; this announcement reverses the trend and plan for a drawdown in the region:

""Today's announcement from the Pentagon signals that our nation is far from ending its longest war. Further military engagement in Afghanistan puts our brave servicemen and women in harm's way while doing nothing to enhance our national security.

For nearly 15 years, our brave servicemen and women have gone above and beyond the call of duty, under nearly impossible circumstances. It's past time to bring them home to their families and end this war.

This war has already cost our nation too much, in blood and in treasure. We have lost 2,381 brave American servicemembers, and more than 20,000 have been wounded.

Every hour, we spend four million dollars fighting this endless war. The $740 billion price tag for this war has undermined our ability to make much-needed investments in our national security and domestic priorities.

In 2001, I opposed the authorization for this war because it allowed any President to wage endless war without the Congressional oversight mandated by the Constitution. While my amendment to the FY2017 NDAA to repeal this blank check for endless war was defeated, I will continue to find every legislative opportunity to re-establish Congress's constitutionally-mandated oversight of war.

The American people, our servicemembers and their families were promised an end to this costly and bloody war. We must keep our promises and bring this war to a close.""",,,07/07/16 03:08 PM

The funding supports revitalization efforts in local communities.

""We are pleased that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has chosen the City of Newport News for this competitive grant award,"" the Senators said. ""Today's funding will help transform local neighborhoods into stronger and more prosperous communities."" 

""Today's announcement from the Department of Housing and Urban Development is great news for the citizens of Newport News,"" said Rep. Scott.  ""These funds will ensure access to safe, affordable housing and help revitalize an historic neighborhood in southeast Newport News.""

The legislation will keep more children safely at home and out of inappropriate foster care placements by promoting evidence-based services that support parents and strengthen families. Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR) of the Senate Finance Committee will introduce a companion bill in the Senate.

Upon introducing the legislation, Chairman Buchanan said:

""We know that strong families make for strong communities. That's why the Family First Prevention Services Act is so important given the current opioid and heroin crisis. This bill is a departure from an outdated system that focuses on caring for children only after they enter into foster care, and instead invests in proven prevention services, including substance abuse treatment, that will keep families together. This legislation offers the types of support that parents need to provide the safe and stable home every child deserves.""

Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) added:

""The Family First Prevention Services Act will help more children grow up in a safe home, surrounded by a stable family. I applaud Chairman Buchanan and Senators Hatch and Wyden for introducing this important legislation. I look forward to advancing this legislation so we can strengthen America's families and deliver positive outcomes for children.""

The Family First Prevention Services Act strengthens families and reduces inappropriate foster care placements by:

    Giving states flexibility to use federal foster care dollars to provide upfront, evidence-based prevention services -- such as parent training and individual and family therapy -- to prevent inappropriate foster care placements and improve outcomes for children and parents.
    Ensuring more foster children are placed with families by ending federal reimbursement when states inappropriately place children in non-family settings.
    Keeping children safe by reauthorizing the Regional Partnership Grant program that provides funding to state and local evidence-based services aimed at preventing child abuse and child neglect due to parental substance abuse.
    Reducing the amount of time foster children wait to be adopted or placed with relatives across state lines by encouraging states to replace their outdated child placement systems with a more efficient electronic system.
    Supporting family members who unexpectedly assume responsibility for a child by providing important caregiver resources and eliminating unnecessary paperwork.",,,07/07/16 03:10 PM
