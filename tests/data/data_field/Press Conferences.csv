This legislation is long overdue."" 

""This federal land transfer is a win-win for all those involved: it saves the American taxpayer money by reducing the federal government's growing footprint of unused properties, it provides the people of Anchorage significant benefit, and it fulfills a need for new growth and economic development within Alaska,"" said Congressman Don Young.

I commend Senator Sullivan, and countless others, for working to make this legislation a reality; it truly was a team effort.""

S. 1492, which has the support of Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz and was supported by former Mayor Dan Sullivan, would specifically direct the General Services Administration, on behalf of the National Archives, to convey the property in Anchorage to the Municipality. The National Archives has determined that it no longer needs the property and supports the sale as part of its efforts to reduce costs to the taxpayer and shrink its overall footprint.

9490,1082086,"Remarks by President Obama in Press Availability -- Ise-Shima, Japan",05/26/16,10,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Hello, everybody.  So, as all of you know, we're going to Hiroshima tomorrow.  And in the interest of getting you all home at a reasonable hour, we're not going to be doing a press conference after, so I thought I'd give you guys a chance to fire off some questions now.

Just a quick comment on the G7 meeting so far.  It's been extremely productive.  I think that one of the benefits of the G7 is that you have likeminded countries who are committed to democracy and free markets, and international law and international norms.  And so for us to be able to get together and focus on critical issues that not only affect individual countries but affect the international order I think is vitally important.  And we very much appreciate the work that the Japanese and Prime Minister Abe have done in organizing an excellent meeting.
 
So far, we've discussed issues of the global economy and the need to continue to accelerate growth, to use all the tools at our disposal to make sure that we're not only putting people back to work but also helping to lift wages and helping to make sure that we can sustain the momentum of the recovery that's taken place in the United States most prominently, but also we're starting to see some progress in Europe.  The fact that the Greek debt crisis has been resolved for a reasonable length of time I think should help.  But we've all got a lot of work to do.  And we agreed to continue to focus on making sure that each country, based on its particular needs and capacities, are taking steps to accelerate growth.
 
We had a chance to talk about trade -- not only TPP and our involvement in that, but also T-TIP -- and recommitted ourselves to making sure that we try to finish those negotiations before the end of the year, and emphasized the importance of pushing back against either protectionism or competitive currency devaluations, or the kinds of beggar-thy-neighbor strategies that all too often end up leaving everybody worse off.
 
We began to touch on some of the key security issues that are important to all of us -- the South China Sea and maritime security.  Touched on issues surrounding Ukraine, where we've started to see some progress in negotiations, but we're still seeing too much violence, and we need to get that resolved.  And we're going to spend some time this evening tackling some of the other major international hotspots.
 
So that gives you an update of where we're at so far.  And with that, I'm just going to dive in, and you guys can ask some questions.  And we're going to start with Gardiner.
 
Q    Mr. President, eleven of your predecessors decided against going to Hiroshima.  What do you know that they didn't?  What were they worried about that you aren't?  
 
And just sort of generally on nonproliferation -- because I think that's your focus and that's obviously a priority for you -- how do you communicate risks and concerns about this in a way that would do more to get it resolved?  Because it seems to be getting worse.  I mean, Americans worry a lot about terrorists with suicide vests, which are unlikely events that can kill dozens.  Do they worry enough about the risks of nuclear mishaps or attacks, which are unlikely events that could potentially kill millions instead of dozens?  In short, are we paying enough attention to Kim Jong-un and Pakistani tactical nuclear weapons, these sorts of things that you know are going on?
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, it's a terrific question.  First of all, I won't characterize how other Presidents were thinking about these issues.  I can tell you how I'm thinking about it, and that is that the dropping of the atomic bomb, the ushering in of nuclear weapons was an inflection point in modern history.  It is something that all of us have had to deal with in one way or another.  Obviously, it's not as prominent in people's thinking as it was during the Cold War, at a time when our parents or grandparents were huddling under desks in frequent drills.  But the backdrop of a nuclear event remains something that I think presses on the back of our imaginations.  
 
I do think that part of the reason I'm going is because I want to once again underscore the very real risks that are out there and the sense of urgency that we all should have.  So it's not only a reminder of the terrible toll of World War II and the death of innocents across continents, but it's also to remind ourselves that the job is not done in reducing conflict, building institutions of peace, and reducing the prospect of nuclear war in the future.
 
In some ways, we've seen real progress over the last several years.  The Iran nuclear deal is a big piece of business -- because without us having to fire a shot, we were able to persuade a big, sophisticated country that had a well-developed nuclear program not to develop nuclear weapons.  The START II Treaty that I negotiated in my first couple years in office with the Russians has reduced our respective stockpiles.  The Nuclear Security Summit and all the work that we've done on that score has made it less likely that nuclear materials fall into the hand of terrorists or non-state actors.  
 
And although we have not seen the kind of progress that I would have liked to have seen with respect to North Korea, what we have been able to do is mobilize the international community so that their proliferation activities are scrutinized much more carefully, and they have far fewer countries that are tolerant of potential actions by North Korea outside of their own program.
 
Having said that, North Korea is a big worry for all of us.  They're not at the point right now where they can effectively hit U.S. targets, but each time that they test -- even if those tests fail -- they learn something.  And it is clear that ideologically they are still convinced that -- and Kim Jong-un in particular seems to be convinced that his own legitimacy is tied up with developing nuclear weapons.  
 
You pointed out the continuing tensions that exist in South Asia.  That is still a concern.  And we know that terrorist organizations would have no compunction about using a weapon of mass destruction if they got their hands on it.  
 
So we've got a lot of work to do.  I think we've built up an architecture during the course of my presidency that has made a difference, that has focused attention on some key points of vulnerability.  But we're not where we need to be yet.  And obviously we haven't achieved all the goals that I set when I spoke in Prague at the beginning of my presidency.  Of course, I noted at the time that I didn't expect to be able to achieve all those goals during the course of my presidency or even in my lifetime.  And this is going to be an ongoing task, but it's one that I think we have to be paying a lot of attention to.
 
Q    One follow-up.  Mr. Kerry, your Secretary of State, called the North Korean nuclear program the biggest threat in the world right now -- the gravest threat.  Do you agree with that?  Do you see this nuclear program as the worst thing going on?
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, it is not the thing necessarily that poses the most immediate risk.  Obviously, ISIL using rifles and crude bombs can kill a lot of people in a Paris or a Brussels.  And people are rightly insistent that the world community stamp out ISIL.  So there's a reason why we are focused on that.  But this is not a situation where we can afford to just focus on the short term.  Over the long term, when you have such an unstable regime that is so isolated, that generally flouts international norms and rules more than perhaps any other nation on Earth, that is also devoting enormous national resources hell-bent on getting nuclear weapons that they can fire long distances -- that poses the kind of medium-term threat that we have to pay a lot of attention to.  
 
And I assure you it's something that my administration has paid a lot of attention to.  It's something that I think has been at the center of the trilateral work that we've done with our close allies in the region.  It's something that we've put at the center of our discussions and negotiations with China.  And as I said before, what we've seen actually is improved responses from countries like China, countries in the region, like Vietnam and Burma taking these issues much more seriously because of our engagement.  And so that may reduce the risks of North Korea selling weapons or fissile material to other countries, or putting it out on the black market.  But it does not, so far at least, solve the core problem of North Korea continuing to develop its program.  And we're going to have to continue to work in a concerted way.  
 
In the meantime, I've been working with the Pentagon for several years now on making sure that we can develop the kinds of defense architecture that can protect the United States and our allies from an unexpected escalation.
 
Carol.
 
Q    Thank you.  You've said before that when you talk to world leaders, they often ask you about the presidential election.  Can you give us a sense of the conversations that you've had so far -- what they're saying to you, what you're saying to them -- particularly now that Donald Trump is the nominee, and he recently said that Japan should pay for the U.S. troop presence?  But also, on the Democratic side, what they're saying about that and what you think of that, because it's obviously continuing to be divisive with Bernie Sanders saying he would take it to the convention.  And he's endorsed your Democratic Party chair, her primary opponent.  Should he change course?  Have you decided that you're just not going to get involved until one of them concedes to the other?
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, look, the world pays attention to the U.S. elections.  They pay more attention to our elections sometimes than we pay to theirs, because the United States is, as I've said before, at the heart of the international order.  And even those countries that are critical of us, even those countries that complain or question particular policy decisions that we make know that ultimately things don't hold together so well if the United States is not making good decisions, and count on us to provide a certain level of stability and direction in meeting global challenges.  
 
So they are paying very close attention to this election.  I think it's fair to say that they are surprised by the Republican nominee.  They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements.  But they're rattled by him -- and for good reason -- because a lot of the proposals that he's made display either ignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous, and what's required to keep the world on an even keel.
 
With respect to the Democratic primary process, as I've said before, it's been my view to let this play out, let voters make up their minds.  And during primaries, people get a little grumpy with each other.  It's just the nature of the process.  You start off and everybody is thinking, oh, this is fine, this is going to be a friendly competition, we're going to debate ideas.  And somebody says one thing and then another person says another thing, and that felt a little sharper than I expected, and somebody's supporter pops off.  And there's a certain buildup of aggravation.  We saw that in my lengthy primary in 2008.  This is no different.  
 
But what I think is really important to remember is that, unlike what you've seen in the Democratic or in Republican primary, for the most part there's not that big a difference ideologically in terms of the issues.  Both Hillary and Bernie believe that every American should have health care.  Both of them think that we've got to make college more affordable.  Both of them believe that it's important for us to have a tax system that is fair, and that we should be closing corporate loopholes in order to pay for things like infrastructure investment and early childhood education. 
 
I mean, if you put their proposals side by side, they're all pointing in the same direction, and the differences are primarily tactical.  They have to do with how do you get some of this stuff done.  So that doesn't mean that those aren't serious questions to ask and debate.  It does mean, though, that once the primary process is resolved, the ability for us to pull together around a common vision that is in sharp contrast to the vision that's being offered on the other side I think is one that will get done by the time of the convention.  
 
I would urge -- and have urged -- both sides to try to stick to the issues, because a lot of that grumpiness arises where folks feel as if we're not talking about an issue but we're talking about personalities and character.  And they're both good people.  I know them both well.  And I think that it's important for us to try to end this in a way that leaves both sides feeling proud of what they've done.  And both sides have run serious, competitive races, and debated issues in a serious way.  So I'm proud of Democrats for doing that.
 
And, Carol, as you know -- I sure know, because I've been through this a bunch of times -- there is just the natural impulse when you're having to report every day on campaigns that every little blip, speed bump, conflict, trash-talking that takes place is elevated -- not to mention polls.  And the one thing I've learned after being around for a while is that kind of day-to-day choppiness is not indicative of longer-term trends.  I feel confident about the Democratic vision for the country, and I feel confident about our ability not just to win elections but, more importantly, to deliver on behalf of the American people and the issues they care about.

Q    Does this going until the end of July make it harder to defeat Mr. Trump?
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  No.  Look, would it be nice if everybody was immediately unified and singing ""Kumbaya,"" and whoever the nominee ended up being could just take a nice two-week vacation to recharge?  Absolutely.  I guarantee you that the eventual nominee sure wishes it was over now, because this is a grind.  It's hard.  And in some ways, one of the things I've always found is that it's a lot more draining arguing against your friends than it is arguing against your political opponents.  It just -- it weighs on you more.  Being criticized by folks who are in your own party always hurts just a little bit more. 
 
And so it takes a little energy out of you.  But these are folks who are serious about trying to solve the country's problems.  They're both veterans of the political grind.  And so they're going to hold up.  And by the time we get to the convention, I'm confident they'll be in good shape.
 
As a special bonus, I'm going to take one more question.  Go ahead.
 
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  You mentioned some tactical differences between the two Democratic candidates.  But when you hear Bernie Sanders speak, it seems like he's talking more about the issue of trustability and the need for a political revolution.  And just yesterday we saw that the State Department's inspector general put out a report about Secretary Clinton's emails, and it basically undermined some of what she said about her email practices.  I'm wondering if you think that undermines her trustworthiness with the American people, and if you agree with Bernie Sanders that she should release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches to Wall Street.
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Okay.  You know what, I take it back.  I'm not taking another question.  (Laughter.)  We're in Japan.  Don't we have something on Asia that we want to talk about?  I'll be talking about this in Washington the whole time.
 
Look, I've already said a lot about those issues.  I think those are better directed to the campaign.  As I said before, during the course of a primary people say what they think might help them get some votes.  And once the campaign is over, then they move on, and they make an assessment in terms of how they can make sure that the vision they care most deeply about has the best chance of passing a Congress and getting signed by a President, and that Supreme Court nominees are confirmed, and all the things that make for a functioning, effective government.
 
So I think that the noise that is going on back and forth between the candidates at this point, if you want insights into how they're thinking about it, those should be directed to them.
 
I'll take --
 
Q    Can I have another question?
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  You've already had a question, so if I'm going to ask another question I think it's fair to give it to --
 
Q    That's true.
 
Q    Can I ask you your thinking on the new Taliban leader and how that affects prospects for peace in the region?
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, as I was saying to my team, I wasn't expecting a liberal democrat to be the newly appointed leader of the Taliban.  So this continues to be an organization that sees violence as a strategy for obtaining its goals and moving its agenda forward in Afghanistan.  We have a democratically elected government in Afghanistan that we're supporting, and our goal right now is to make sure that that constitution and that democratic process is upheld -- not to mention that we're able to maintain the counterterrorism platforms that we need in that region so that al Qaeda and now ISIL are not able to take root and use that as bases to attack us in the United States.
 
My hope -- although not my expectation -- is that there comes a point at which the Taliban recognizes that they are not going to simply be able to overrun the country and that what they need to be doing is to enter into serious reconciliation talks that are led by Afghans.  And I think if that happens, that's something that the United States and others in the world community would support.  But I am doubtful that that will be happening anytime soon.  And we'll have to wait and see how those things develop.
 
In the short term, we anticipate that the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence and VBEDS and blowing up innocent people, and the kinds of actions that have characterized their approach over the last 15, 20 years.  But I do think that there will come a point, perhaps not this year, next year, but eventually, where there are those within the community that surrounds the Taliban, at least, that recognize their goals are best achieved by negotiations.
 
Okay?
 
Q    And on the Vietnamese activists that were banned from the meeting --
 
Q    Right, is that embarrassing that they couldn't --
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  To me, or to them?  Why is it embarrassing to me?
 
Q    Well, because you invited these people and they didn't show up.  
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, I wasn't the one who held them up.  Look, I was very blunt with the Vietnamese government.  There is so much good going on in that country, and what I indicated to them is that these kinds of heavy-handed actions end up being entirely counterproductive.  And the folks we invited, including those who were there, are people that are prepared to have a constructive conversation with the government about how to advance peace and prosperity, and economic development, and environmental security in that country.  
 
And my general message, as you heard at the youth town hall meeting, is harness that talent.  Let them loose to create startups and to solve problems, and engage them.  It's the same message I had with Cuba.  It's the same message that I had in a wide range of countries where you still are seeing serious problems with human rights.  
 
The one thing I'm absolutely convinced of, though, is, is that by us engaging, by us meeting with civil society activists, it helps move the ball, it moves the needle.  It doesn't solve these problems immediately.  Right now Burma/Myanmar is undergoing this democratic transformation, in part because of the process that we helped to spearhead.  They are going through revolutionary changes over the last several years.  But I guarantee you that there's still some human rights activists inside of Burma/Myanmar who are being harassed, are not able to speak freely, are not able to assemble the way we would expect them to be able to do in our own country.
 
When I went to Cuba and I met with those dissidents, one of the individuals who was there still had cuts in his wrists from handcuffs because he had been detained just the day before.  I didn't come out of that meeting thinking the problems of human rights in Cuba are solved.  But what I'm pretty darn sure of is, is that by us meeting with them, by us shining a spotlight on their stories, by us indicating not that we were going to dictate how these societies develop, but that we do think there are certain universal values that we care deeply about and that we're going to stand with -- that that helps.  
 
And that, I think, is the biggest lesson over the course of the seven years as we've been engaging some of these countries with serious human rights problems.  The expectation that I think sometimes we've had that I've we just stand back and scold, that somehow that's going to change these internal dynamics has proven to be less effective than us engaging.  Indicating to governments that we're prepared to work with them, but that they need to make progress, and continually trying to lift up the actions of these civil society leaders in a way that provides them a little bit more space, and that space slowly grows and it ends up being a process -- and it's not always a process that travels in a straight line.  Sometimes you take two steps forward, you take a step back.  Sometimes you start seeing openings in some of these societies, and then governments get nervous and they clamp back down.  
 
But that steady pressure, combined with an appreciation of the history of these countries, combined with a willingness to listen, combined with an ability to mobilize the international community so that we're not thinking that we're doing this all by ourselves -- over time, we've seen results.  More modest than I would hope, but that's true of pretty much everything about foreign policy and domestic policy and the human condition.
 
All right?

27584,1082412,Byrne Votes to Protect Access to Retirement Advice for American Families,04/28/16,10,"Congressman Bradley Byrne (R-AL), a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, voted today to block the Obama Administration's ""fiduciary"" rule, which would restrict access to retirement advice for American families.

This rule will impose new standards and regulations on financial advisors while also expanding the definition of who is required to comply. Studies have found the increased compliance costs could be over $2 billion. The added costs will be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher costs and fees.

The rule will be especially hard on low- and middle-income families who will no longer be able to afford retirement advice. The rule may also restrict small businesses' ability to offer retirement options to their employees.

Byrne said: ""I am pleased the House acted today to stop the Obama Administration's ill-conceived ""fiduciary' rule. Republicans and Democrats agree that financial advisors should act in the best interest of the consumer, but there is a far better way to ensure the bad actors are punished than hurting everyone else in the process.

""No one would be hurt more by this rule than low- and middle-income families who arguably need this financial advice the most. I hope the Senate will act soon on our legislation to ensure each and every American has access to retirement advice.""

H. J. Res. 88, the resolution disapproving of the ""fiduciary"" rule, passed by a vote of 234 to 183.",,,05/31/16 10:56 AM
9490,1086998,"Remarks by the President After Briefing on the Attack in Orlando, Florida",06/13/16,10,"THE PRESIDENT:  I just had the opportunity to get the latest briefing from FBI Director Comey, as well as Deputy Attorney General Yates and the rest of my national security team about the tragedy that took place in Orlando.  They're going to be doing a more extensive briefing around noon -- just a little bit after noon over at FBI headquarters.  So I will allow them to go into all the details, but I thought it was important for you to hear directly from me.

First of all, our hearts go out to the families of those who have been killed.  Our prayers go to those who have been wounded.  This is a devastating attack on all Americans.  It is one that is particularly painful for the people of Orlando, but I think we all recognize that this could have happened anywhere in this country.  And we feel enormous solidarity and grief on behalf of the families that have been affected.

The fact that it took place at a club frequented by the LGBT community I think is also relevant.  We're still looking at all the motivations of the killer.  But it's a reminder that regardless of race, religion, faith or sexual orientation, we're all Americans, and we need to be looking after each other and protecting each other at all times in the face of this kind of terrible act.

With respect to the killer, there's been a lot of reporting that's been done.  It's important to emphasize that we're still at the preliminary stages of the investigation, and there's a lot more that we have to learn.  The one thing that we can say is that this is being treated as a terrorist investigation.  It appears that the shooter was inspired by various extremist information that was disseminated over the Internet.  All those materials are currently being searched, exploited so we will have a better sense of the pathway that the killer took in making the decision to launch this attack. 

As Director Comey I think will indicate, at this stage we see no clear evidence that he was directed externally.  It does appear that, at the last minute, he announced allegiance to ISIL, but there is no evidence so far that he was in fact directed by ISIL.  And there also at this stage is no direct evidence that he was part of a larger plot.  In that sense, it appears to be similar to what we saw in San Bernardino, but we don't yet know.  And this is part of what is going to be important in terms of the investigation.

As far as we can tell right now, this is certainly an example of the kind of homegrown extremism that all of us have been so concerned about for a very long time.  It also appears that he was able to obtain these weapons legally because he did not have a criminal record that, in some ways, would prohibit him from purchasing these weapons.  It appears that one of those weapons he was able to just carry out of the store -- an assault rifle, a handgun -- a Glock -- which had a lot of clips in it.  He was apparently required to wait for three days under Florida law.  But it does indicate the degree to which it was not difficult for him to obtain these kinds of weapons.

Director Comey will discuss the fact that there had been some investigation of him in the past that was triggered, but as Director Comey I think will indicate, the FBI followed the procedures that they were supposed to and did a proper job.

At the end of the day, this is something that we are going to have to grapple with -- making sure that even as we go after ISIL and other extremist organizations overseas, even as we hit their leadership, even as we go after their infrastructure, even as we take key personnel off the field, even as we disrupt external plots -- that one of the biggest challenges we are going to have is this kind of propaganda and perversions of Islam that you see generated on the Internet, and the capacity for that to seep into the minds of troubled individuals or weak individuals, and seeing them motivated then to take actions against people here in the United States and elsewhere in the world that are tragic.  And so countering this extremist ideology is increasingly going to be just as important as making sure that we are disrupting more extensive plots engineered from the outside. 

We are also going to have to have to make sure that we think about the risks we are willing to take by being so lax in how we make very powerful firearms available to people in this country.  And this is something that obviously I've talked about for a very long time. 

My concern is that we start getting into a debate, as has happened in the past, which is an either/or debate.  And the suggestion is either we think about something as terrorism and we ignore the problems with easy access to firearms, or it's all about firearms and we ignore the role -- the very real role that that organizations like ISIL have in generating extremist views inside this country.  And it's not an either/or.  It's a both/and.

We have to go after these terrorist organizations and hit them hard.  We have to counter extremism.  But we also have to make sure that it is not easy for somebody who decides they want to harm people in this country to be able to obtain weapons to get at them. 

And my hope is, is that over the next days and weeks that we are being sober about how we approach this problem, that we let the facts get determined by our investigators, but we also do some reflecting in terms of how we can best tackle what is going to be a very challenging problem not just here in this country, but around the world.

Again, my final point is just to extend our deepest sympathies to the families of those who were affected and to send our prayers to those who are surviving and are in hospitals right now, and their family members hoping that they get better very soon.

But in the meantime, you can anticipate sometime around noon that Director Comey and Deputy Attorney General Yates will provide you with a more full briefing about this.  Okay?

Q    Mr. President, is there anything more to the LBGT angle to this?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we don't yet know the motivations.  But here's what we do know -- is organizations like ISIL or organizations like al Qaeda, or those who have perverted Islam and created these radical, nihilistic, vicious organizations, one of the groups that they target are gays and lesbians because they believe that they do not abide by their attitudes towards sexuality.

Now, we also know these are organizations that think it's fine to take captive women and enslave them and rape them.  So there clearly are connections between the attitudes in an organization like this and their attitudes towards tolerance and pluralism and a belief that all people are created equally regardless of sexual orientation.  That is something threatening to them.  Women being empowered is threatening to them. 

So, yes, I'm sure we will find that there are connections -- regardless of the particular motivations of this killer -- there are connections between this vicious, bankrupt ideology and general attitudes towards gays and lesbians.  And unfortunately, that's something that the LGBT community is subject to not just by ISIL but by a lot of groups that purport to speak on behalf of God around the world.

Q    What are your thoughts about the fact that after all of these incidents over these years, that there has not been any move to reform gun control in this country?

THE PRESIDENT:  April, I think you know what I think about it.  The fact that we make it this challenging for law enforcement, for example, even to get alerted that somebody who they are watching has purchased a gun -- and if they do get alerted, sometimes it's hard for them to stop them from getting a gun -- is crazy.  It's a problem.  And we have to, I think, do some soul-searching.

But again, the danger here is, is that then it ends up being the usual political debate.  And the NRA and the gun control folks say that, oh, Obama doesn't want to talk about terrorism.  And if you talk about terrorism, then people say why aren't you looking at issues of gun control.

The point is, is that if we have self-radicalized individuals in this country, then they are going to be very difficult oftentimes to find ahead of time.  And how easy it is for them to obtain weapons is, in some cases, going to make a difference as to whether they're able to carry out attacks like this or not.  And we make it very easy for individuals who are troubled or disturbed or want to engage in violent acts to get very powerful weapons very quickly.  And that's a problem. 

It's a problem regardless of their motivations.  It's a problem for a young man who can walk into a church in South Carolina and murder nine people who offered to pray with him.  It's a problem when an angry young man on a college campus decides to shoot people because he feels disrespected.  It's certainly a problem when we have organizations like ISIL or al Qaeda who are actively trying to promote violence and are doing so very effectively over the Internet, because we know that at some point there are going to be, out of 300 million, there are going to be some individuals who find for whatever reason that kind of horrible propaganda enticing.  And if that happens, and that person can get a weapon, that's a problem.",,,06/14/16 11:16 AM
136102,1087868,Congressman Dan Kildee's Remarks at Press Event Calling on Congress to #DoYourJob and Act on Flint Aid,05/26/16,10,"Congressman Dan Kildee (MI-05) today spoke at a bicameral press event on the steps of the U.S. Capitol urging Republicans in Congress to do their job and act on a federal aid package for Flint in the wake of the city's water crisis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid also spoke at the event. Kildee, Pelosi and Reid were joined by other members of the House and Senate Democratic Caucuses.

Below is a transcript of Congressman Kildee's remarks, as delivered:

""I represent Flint, Michigan, a city of 100,000 people that for the last two years has not been able to drink their water. It has been poisoned by lead. Through no fault of their own, 9,000 children under the age of six have had lead go into their bodies -- lead is a neurotoxin.

""But two years later, Congress has not yet acted to help the people of my hometown. Even though the federal government did not create this crisis, the people who live in my hometown, the people of Flint -- they are citizens of Flint, they are citizens of Michigan, they are citizens of the United States of America.

""One of the first votes that I cast after I was elected in 2012 was to provide relief to the people of the East Coast who were suffering as a result of Hurricane Sandy. I was proud to cast that vote because I was proud as my colleagues were to stand with our fellow Americans, to help people who were in their moment of greatest need.

""Congress needs to do its job and help the people of my hometown. They have waited far too long. And we know what we need to do. We need to provide the basic help to fix the infrastructure and provide the support -- especially to those kids -- who now face an additional hurdle because of the actions, the callous actions, of those in state government.

""We could do it today. Congress needs to do what it must do to stand with the people of Flint, Michigan, and help them through this crisis. Congress needs to do their job.""",,,06/15/16 02:36 PM

775,1091181,Norton and Home-Rule Coalition to Lead Defense of D.C. Laws During Upcoming Appropriations Process While Mayor Bowser and D.C. Go Forward with Budget Autonomy,05/09/16,10,"The office of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) released her statement at a press conference today on efforts to protect District of Columbia home rule during the fiscal year 2017 appropriations process.

In addition to Norton, the speakers are D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser; Dana Singiser, Vice President for Public Policy and Government Affairs, Planned Parenthood Federation of America; Louise Melling, Deputy Legal Director and Director of Center for Liberty, American Civil Liberties Union; Brian Malte, Senior National Policy Director, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence; Kaitlyn Boecker, Policy Coordinator, Drug Policy Alliance; and Kimberly Perry, Executive Director, DC Vote.

Organizations in the coalition attending today's press conference include: AIDS United, All* Above All, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Catholics for Choice, Center for Reproductive Rights, DCMJ, Human Rights Campaign, Marijuana Policy Project, NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Abortion Federation, National Health Law Program, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and National Women's Law Center.

Norton's remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:

Statement of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton at D.C. Appropriations Riders Press Conference with Mayor Bowser and National Organizations

Once again, I am pleased to welcome our mayor, Muriel Bowser, and our extraordinary home-rule coalition of national and local organizations.  We are particularly grateful for the efforts of the coalition in aggressively defending D.C.'s laws, which simultaneously allows them to defend their own great issues.  Both are under attack this year as they are every year.  Although we hold this press conference annually with the mayor of our city and our coalition, the context this year is different.  D.C. residents approved a referendum in 2013 authorizing local officials to sever D.C.'s local budget from the federal appropriations process, and that referendum has been upheld in court.  Consequently, the District has served notice it will implement its local fiscal year 2017 budget without waiting for a vote of approval by the House and Senate.  In addition, Mayor Bowser has asked for a vote by residents on D.C. statehood and a state constitution in November.  If the new D.C. statehood constitution follows the genius of the federal constitution, it will not be a policy document to be picked apart by the Congress, but a statement of government functions.

Yet, even before the city embarks on its budget autonomy and statehood strategies, Republicans are responding as never before because they see budget autonomy as an achievable threat.  A spokesperson for Speaker Paul Ryan has said House leadership is considering ""legislative options"" to nullify the budget autonomy referendum.  In addition, a subcommittee of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold a hearing this Thursday on the referendum, with lawyers as witnesses, determined to show that the referendum is illegal.  Furthermore, although the District won an important budget autonomy victory in the Superior Court in March, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives (BLAG), which speaks for the House in litigation and is controlled by Republican leadership, has filed amicus briefs supporting every court challenge to the city's referendum, including a case pending in the District's federal district court now.  We are grateful that Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) declined to join the briefs.  Nevertheless, the House will probably try to continue the usual appropriations process for the D.C. budget, while at the same time trying to block the District's effort to implement its own local budget without submitting it to the congressional appropriations process.

If the House is moving on offense and defense, so is the District.  Historically, the District is annually on the defensive as Members of Congress use the appropriations process to play with the District's laws as if they were a bunch of toys, doing whatever they like to press their partisan agendas at the District's expense.  Nevertheless, here in the Congress, we succeed more often than we fail, as with the needle exchange rider, which has not reappeared.  Yet, sometimes we fail, as with the current rider that bars local funding for abortion services for low-income women.

As long as the District is content with delegated home rule--and that's what the city has, not even home rule, but self-government delegated by Congress that can be taken back in its entirety at will, or as Congress routinely prefers, piece by piece, law by law--as long as we are satisfied with occupying a position lower than that of most 19th century European colonies, we will be in a perpetual fight against intrusions into the local affairs of the District of Columbia that we defend annually.  As long as we fight for budget autonomy or statehood episodically, Congress will be successful in waiting us out.  The most recent interferences are emblematic--three attempts to overturn D.C.'s gun laws by Republicans running for president we beat back last year, but at the same time the marijuana referendum was saved by a loophole, only to meet another rider that keeps the city from taxing or regulating cannabis.

I am enormously grateful that Mayor Bowser's statehood initiative and commission for the first time gives us two strategies--the strong defense against the D.C. Appropriations riders we announce today and an affirmative strategy that puts the Congress on the defensive.  The need for both cannot be clearer.  We must fight these riders until they are gone, but on offense for the first time, we are also turning the tables on the Congress this year.

We cannot ignore this year's appropriations process as if we had already prevailed on budget autonomy and statehood.  We need our coalition to reach Members where they can feel it: in their home districts and states.  To buttress the coalition's efforts, if there are attempts to overturn our local laws, I will force roll call votes on each and every rider targeting D.C. laws--whether attempts to block D.C. laws on reproductive rights, LGBT equality, marijuana reform, gun safety, or abortion, we will respond here as the coalition goes into Members' districts and states.

We have seen success in this work before.  Last year, facing the first all-Republican Congress in a decade, the Republican Senate reported out a D.C. appropriations bill with no riders.  The House, however, was able to reattach the abortion and marijuana riders in the omnibus.  Our coalition is in a good position to let the constituents back home know which Members are violating their own local control principles by trying to use federal power against another Member's district instead of taking care of the business of their own districts.

In addition to Mayor Bowser, we welcome today a broad array of national and local organizations: AIDS United, All* Above All, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Catholics for Choice, Center for Reproductive Rights, DCMJ, Human Rights Campaign, Marijuana Policy Project, NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Abortion Federation, National Health Law Program, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and National Women's Law Center.  Speaking for the coalition will be the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Drug Policy Alliance, and DC Vote.",,,06/17/16 11:12 AM
552,1093485,"McGovern, House Democrats Call Out Speaker Ryan for Pushing Same Dangerous and Divisive Policies as Donald Trump",06/08/16,10,"""Nothing has frustrated me more in recent years than watching Republicans, day after day, beat up on poor people, belittle their struggle, diminish them, and present policies -- quite frankly -- that disrespect them.

""The Speaker of the House and House Republicans yesterday announced their so-called anti-poverty program and it is the same old, same old. It consists of retreads, oldies, but goodies from their conservative playbook.

""It looks like it was pieced together in the basement of Trump Tower because it does nothing to help lift people up and does everything to help put people down. And enough is enough.

""I think what bothers me even more is that the Republican narrative about poverty doesn't reflect the reality. They would have you believe that poor people are poor because they want to be poor. They would have you believe that people living on SNAP are living the high life. That it's the easy way to get by.

""The reality is that being poor in this country is hard work. A lot of the people who are struggling in poverty work for a living. They work full-time. Sometimes they work multiple jobs. The majority of people on SNAP who are able to work actually do work, but they earn so little that they still qualify for food stamps.

""Why aren't we talking about raising the minimum wage to a livable wage? Why aren't we talking about ways to make work pay so that people don't have to be in poverty. But that's not what's in the Republican plan.

""It consists of more and more targeted cuts to programs that provide basic necessities like food. It is unconscionable what they have proposed and what they would do.

""Look, I think there's no difference between what the House Republicans are proposing and what Donald Trump is proposing on the campaign trail. They don't have a clue about what it's like to be poor in this country. And Democrats are going to stand up and fight them. Democrats have solutions that could actually help get people out of poverty and put people back to work. Create good jobs that pay decent wages.

""So I hope it is clear to everyone, even those who have a quick glance at the proposal that Speaker Ryan has released that it basically amounts to nothing new. Nothing innovative. Certainly nothing bipartisan. And my hope is that none of the stuff he's proposed will go anywhere.

""And finally, I'll just say, to keep on doing this, to keep on scapegoating poor people, to keep on beating up on poor people is just a lousy thing to do.""",,,06/22/16 08:59 AM
9490,1096106,Remarks by the President on the Supreme Court Decision on U.S. Versus Texas,06/23/16,10,"THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everybody.  I wanted to say a few words on two of the cases the Supreme Court spoke on today.

First, in the affirmative action case, I'm pleased that the Supreme Court upheld the basic notion that diversity is an important value in our society, and that this country should provide a high-quality education to all our young people, regardless of their background.  We are not a country that guarantees equal outcomes, but we do strive to provide an equal shot to everybody.  And that's what was upheld today.

Second, one of the reasons why America is such a diverse and inclusive nation is because we're a nation of immigrants.  Our Founders conceived of this country as a refuge for the world.  And for more than two centuries, welcoming wave after wave of immigrants has kept us youthful and dynamic and entrepreneurial. It has shaped our character, and it has made us stronger.  

But for more than two decades now, our immigration system, everybody acknowledges, has been broken.  And the fact that the Supreme Court wasn't able to issue a decision today doesn't just set the system back even further, it takes us further from the country that we aspire to be.

Just to lay out some basic facts that sometimes get lost in what can be an emotional debate.  Since I took office, we've deployed more border agents and technology to our southern border than ever before.  That has helped cut illegal border crossings to their lowest levels since the 1970s.  It should have paved the way for comprehensive immigration reform.  And, in fact, as many of you know, it almost did.  Nearly 70 Democrats and Republicans in the Senate came together to pass a smart, common-sense bill that would have doubled the border patrol, and offered undocumented immigrants a pathway to earn citizenship if they paid a fine, paid their taxes, and played by the rules.

Unfortunately, Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to allow a simple yes or no vote on that bill.  So I was left with little choice but to take steps within my existing authority to make our immigration system smarter, fairer, and more just.  

Four years ago, we announced that those who are our lowest priorities for enforcement -- diligent, patriotic young DREAMers who grew up pledging allegiance to our flag -- should be able to apply to work here and study here and pay their taxes here.  More than 730,000 lives have been changed as a result.  These are students, they're teachers, they're doctors, they're lawyers.  They're Americans in every way but on paper.  And fortunately, today's decision does not affect this policy.  It does not affect the existing DREAMers.  

Two years ago, we announced a similar, expanded approach for others who are also low priorities for enforcement.  We said that if you've been in America for more than five years, with children who are American citizens or legal residents, then you, too, can come forward, get right with the law, and work in this country temporarily, without fear of deportation. 

Both were the kinds of actions taken by Republican and Democratic Presidents over the past half-century.  Neither granted anybody a free pass.  All they did was focus our enforcement resources -- which are necessarily limited -- on the highest priorities:  convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and threats to our national security. 

Now, as disappointing as it was to be challenged for taking the kind of actions that other administrations have taken, the country was looking to the Supreme Court to resolve the important legal questions raised in this case.  Today, the Supreme Court was unable to reach a decision.  This is part of the consequence of the Republican failure so far to give a fair hearing to Mr. Merrick Garland, my nominee to the Supreme Court.  It means that the expanded set of common-sense deferred action policies -- the ones that I announced two years ago -- can't go forward at this stage, until there is a ninth justice on the Court to break the tie.

I know a lot of people are going to be disappointed today, but it is important to understand what today means.  The deferred action policy that has been in place for the last four years is not affected by this ruling.  Enforcement priorities developed by my administration are not affected by this ruling.  This means that the people who might have benefitted from the expanded deferred action policies -- long-term residents raising children who are Americans or legal residents -- they will remain low priorities for enforcement.  As long as you have not committed a crime, our limited immigration enforcement resources are not focused on you.

But today's decision is frustrating to those who seek to grow our economy and bring a rationality to our immigration system, and to allow people to come out of the shadows and lift this perpetual cloud on them.  I think it is heartbreaking for the millions of immigrants who've made their lives here, who've raised families here, who hoped for the opportunity to work, pay taxes, serve in our military, and more fully contribute to this country we all love in an open way.  

So where do we go from here?  

Most Americans -- including business leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement, Democrats and Republicans and independents 
-- still agree that the single best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass common-sense, bipartisan immigration reform.  

That is obviously not going to happen during the remainder of this Congress.  We don't have is a Congress that agrees with us on this.  Nor do we have a Congress that's willing to do even its most basic of jobs under the Constitution, which is to consider nominations.  Republicans in Congress currently are willfully preventing the Supreme Court from being fully staffed and functioning as our Founders intended.  And today's situation underscores the degree to which the Court is not able to function the way it's supposed to.  

The Court's inability to reach a decision in this case is a very clear reminder of why it's so important for the Supreme Court to have a full bench.  For more than 40 years, there's been an average of just over two months between a nomination and a hearing.  I nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court more than three months ago.  But most Republicans so far refuse to even meet with him.  They are allowing partisan politics to jeopardize something as fundamental as the impartiality and integrity of our justice system.  And America should not let it stand.

This is an election year.  And during election years, politicians tend to use the immigration issue to scare people with words like ""amnesty"" in hopes that it will whip up votes.  Keep in mind that millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking effort to become citizens.  And we don't like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship. But here's the thing.  Millions of people who have come forward and worked to get right with the law under this policy, they've  been living here for years, too -- in some cases, even decades.  So leaving the broken system the way it is, that's not a solution.  In fact, that's the real amnesty.  Pretending we can deport 11 million people, or build a wall without spending tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer money is abetting what is really just factually incorrect.  It's not going to work.  It's not good for this country.  It's a fantasy that offers nothing to help the middle class, and demeans our tradition of being both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.  

In the end, it is my firm belief that immigration is not something to fear.  We don't have to wall ourselves off from those who may not look like us right now, or pray like we do, or have a different last name.  Because being an American is about something more than that.  What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal that all of us are created equal, all of us have a chance to make of our lives what we will.  And every study shows that whether it was the Irish or the Poles, or the Germans, or the Italians, or the Chinese, or the Japanese, or the Mexicans, or the Kenyans -- whoever showed up, over time, by a second generation, third generation, those kids are Americans.  They do look like us -- because we don't look one way.  We don't all have the same last names, but we all share a creed and we all share a commitment to the values that founded this nation.  That's who we are.  And that is what I believe most Americans recognize.  

So here's the bottom line.  We've got a very real choice that America faces right now.  We will continue to implement the existing programs that are already in place.  We're not going to be able to move forward with the expanded programs that we wanted to move forward on because the Supreme Court was not able to issue a ruling at this stage.  And now we've got a choice about who we're going to be as a country, what we want to teach our kids, and how we want to be represented in Congress and in the White House.

We're going to have to make a decision about whether we are a people who tolerate the hypocrisy of a system where the workers who pick our fruit or make our beds never have the chance to get right with the law -- or whether we're going to give them a chance, just like our forebears had a chance, to take responsibility and give their kids a better future.

We're going to have to decide whether we're a people who accept the cruelty of ripping children from their parents' arms 
-- or whether we actually value families, and keep them together for the sake of all of our communities.

We're going to have to decide whether we're a people who continue to educate the world's brightest students in our high schools and universities, only to then send them away to compete against us -- or whether we encourage them to stay and create new jobs and new businesses right here in the United States.

These are all the questions that voters now are going to have to ask themselves, and are going to have to answer in November.  These are the issues that are going to be debated by candidates across the country -- both congressional candidates as well as the presidential candidates.  And in November, Americans are going to have to make a decision about what we care about and who we are.

I promise you this, though -- sooner or later, immigration reform will get done.  Congress is not going to be able to ignore America forever.  It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. And I can say that with confidence because we've seen our history.  We get these spasms of politics around immigration and fear-mongering, and then our traditions and our history and our better impulses kick in.  That's how we all ended up here.  Because I guarantee you, at some point, every one of us has somebody in our background who people didn't want coming here, and yet here we are.  

And that's what's going to happen this time.  The question is, do we do it in a smart, rational, sensible way -- or we just keep on kicking the can down the road.  I believe that this country deserves an immigration policy that reflects the goodness of the American people.  And I think we're going to get that.  Hopefully, we're going to get that in November.

All right.  I'll take two questions.  Two questions.  Go ahead.    

Q    Thank you.
 
THE PRESIDENT:  I'll take two questions.  Go ahead.

Q    Thank you.  Realistically, what do you see is the risk of deportation for these more than 4 million people?  I mean, you say we can't deport 11 million.  This is 4 million, and there's a chunk of time here before something else --

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me just be very clear.  What was unaffected by today's ruling -- or lack of a ruling -- is the enforcement priorities that we've put in place.  And our enforcement priorities that have been laid out by Secretary Jeh Johnson at the Department of Homeland Security are pretty clear: We prioritize criminals.  We prioritize gangbangers.  We prioritize folks who have just come in.  What we don't do is to prioritize people who've been here a long time, who are otherwise law-abiding, who have roots and connections in their communities.

And so those enforcement priorities will continue.  

The work that we've done with the DREAM Act kids, those policies remain in place.  So what this has prevented us from doing is expanding the scope of what we've done with the DREAM Act kids.  Keep in mind, though, that even that was just a temporary measure.  All it was doing was basically saying to these kids, you can have confidence that you are not going to be deported, but it does not resolve your ultimate status.  That is going to require congressional action.

So, although I'm disappointed by the lack of a decision today by the Supreme Court, a deadlock, this does not substantially change the status quo, and it doesn't negate what has always been the case, which is if we're really going to solve this problem effectively, we've got to have Congress pass a law.

I have pushed to the limits of my executive authority.  We now have to have Congress act.  And hopefully, we're going to have a vigorous debate during this election -- this is how democracy is supposed to work -- and there will be a determination as to which direction we go in.  

As I said, over the long term, I'm very confident about the direction this country will go in because we've seen this in the past.  If we hadn't seen it in the past, America would look very different than it looks today.  But whether we're going to get this done now, soon, so that this does not continue to be this divisive force in our politics, and we can get down to the business of all pulling together to create jobs, and educate our kids, and protect ourselves from external threats, and do the things that we need to do to ensure a better future for the next generation, that's going to be determined in part by how voters turn out and who they vote for in November.

All right.  One more question.  Go ahead.

Q    Two practical, going-forward questions.  Number one, is this going to -- are you going to be able to do anything more at all for immigrants going forward in terms of executive action before the election of the next president?  And number two, do you in any way take this as some Republicans have presented this, as a slap at your use of executive authority, this tie vote?  And will this in any way circumscribe how aggressively or forcefully you use executive authority for the remainder of your time in office?

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  On the specifics of immigration, I don't anticipate that there are additional executive actions that we can take.  We can implement what we've already put in place that is not affected by this decision.  But we have to follow, now, what has been ruled on in the Fifth Circuit because the Supreme Court could not resolve the issue.  

And we're going to have to abide by that ruling until an election and a confirmation of a ninth justice of the Supreme Court so that they can break this tie.  Because we've always said that we are going to do what we can lawfully through executive action, but we can't go beyond that.  And we've butted up about as far as we can on this particular topic.  

It does not have any impact on, from our perspective, on the host of other issues that we're working on, because each one of these issues has a different analysis and is based on different statutes or different interpretations of our authority.

So, for example, on climate change, that's based on the Clean Air Act and the EPA and previous Supreme Court rulings, as opposed to a theory of prosecutorial discretion that, in the past, has -- every other President has exercised.  And the Supreme Court wasn't definitive one way or the other on this.  I mean, the problem is they don't have a ninth justice.  So that will continue to be a problem.

With respect to the Republicans, I think what it tells you is, is that if you keep on blocking judges from getting on the bench, then courts can't issue decisions.  And what that means is then you're going to have the status quo frozen, and we're not going to be able to make progress on some very important issues.

Now, that may have been their strategy from the start.  But it's not a sustainable strategy.  And it's certainly a strategy that will be broken by this election -- unless their basic theory is, is that we will never confirm judges again.  Hopefully, that's not their theory, because that's not how a democracy is designed.  

Q    You reject their portrayal of this as a chastisement of you for your use of executive authority?

THE PRESIDENT:  It was a one-word opinion that said, we can't come up with a decision.  I think that would be a little bit of a stretch, yes.  Maybe the next time they can -- if we have a full Court issuing a full opinion on anything, then we take it seriously.  This we have to abide by, but it wasn't any kind of value statement or a decision on the merits of these issues.  

All right?  Thank you, guys.",,,06/24/16 08:36 AM
26732,1096233,Transcript of Pelosi Press Conference Today,05/19/16,10,"Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi held her weekly press conference today.  Below is a transcript of the press conference.  

Leader Pelosi.  Good morning, everyone.  Sadly, we all awakened this morning to the very sad news of the EgyptAir plane going down.  Of course, our prayers and thoughts are with the families, mostly Egyptians, French, and then some other countries, some children.  They said even infants.  So tragic, so sad.  

And back here, we have faced some challenges since last week.  We passed the May 15 date, which is when we were expecting a budget from the Republican side.  No matter how bad the budget was, a road to ruin, it still wasn't bad enough to get a majority vote from the Republican side.  I said over and over:  Show us your values, show us your budget.  That's where we see the values. 

And here we had a series of actions of these last -- in this short period of time that show a complete difference in values. 

It has been almost 90 days since the President submitted his emergency supplemental request for Zika.  House Republicans have dawdled, delayed, obstructed while mosquito season nears.  Voting, after last night, four times to block the 1.9 [billion] emergency Zika supplemental that the President has asked for.  The Republicans found time in the recent -- leading up to now, for five weeks of recess but no time to act on this crisis with the urgency it deserves. 

Dr. Tom Frieden, the Director of the CDC, said: ""Never before in history has there been a situation where a bite from a mosquito can result in devastating fetal malformations.  These children born, not only are they physically deformed, but they may never walk.  They may never talk.  They may never see.  They may never hear.  It will cost $10 million to take care of a child, the lifetime of a child so affected.""

The House Republican bill is reckless and radically unequal to the seriousness of the threat.  Just think of it this way:  They gave less than one&#8209;third of what the President asked for.  They didn't make it an emergency.  So they took the funds from other investments, like Ebola, which have their purpose and should be left intact. 

But the really shocking part of this -- and you wonder, I know they don't really value science, but this one even goes beyond that -- less than one&#8209;fifth was requested for the CDC public health activity.  This is the point of the spear in addressing a public health emergency.  Around $750 million was asked for for the CDC for prevention, for vector control, money to go into communities to fight this.  And they got $100&#8209;, $750&#8209;, they got $120 million.  It is appalling.  It is stunning. 

And the mayors, the governors, the local -- the first line of defense is where people live -- they really need this assistance.  It may sound -- of course, it sounds like a lot of money, but it is a small price to pay for the public health of our country, for the well&#8209;being of our families at a time when these mosquitos -- for the first time, if you get bitten by a mosquito -- and that virus can be sexually transmitted -- it can cause malformations in our children.  As summer approaches, the intensity of the need increases.  This is appalling. 

At the same time, yesterday, we had a markup on nutrition.  You wouldn't believe what I would tell you about what the debate was there.  I commend [Congressman] Bobby Scott and House Democrats for being very calm and reserved as they made the case about [what] a country as great as America should be feeding its children.  And to hear the Republican response to that and the fact that it was a party&#8209;line vote about whether we feed our children, give them the proper nutrition, is, again, show me your values, show me your budget. 

Yesterday, we had on the floor the defense bill.  I'm very pleased that our Members have agreed to sustain a Presidential veto of such a bill, a bill that Ash Carter, our Secretary of Defense, has said is deeply troubling and flawed; gambling with warfighters' money at a time of war dispirits our troops and their friends, baffles friends and emboldens foes.  Just amazing.  And then the leadership of the committee on the Republican side goes to the floor and says:  If you don't vote for the defense bill, you are not supporting our troops.  That is not true.  And I remind all of you, if you have forgotten our work here, that, in 2010, when we were successful in the majority of placing a repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell' in the Defense Authorization bill, the same bill that was on the floor yesterday, guess how many Republicans voted for the Defense Authorization bill that year with the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell' in it?  A single digit: Nine.  Nine.  It is like, do they have no memory of their own actions?  Nine.  So we don't need any lectures from them about how we support our troops. 

The President's proposal and the Secretary of Defense, they have made clear the difference between really protecting our troops or the gimmickry, the budget gimmickry they have come up with.  Also, in this bill, they, in a dead-of-night amendment, added in markup a provision to overturn President Obama's historic executive order banning anti&#8209;LGBT discrimination by Federal contractors.  Last night, on an MTR, the House Republicans voted unanimously to support overturning the President's executive order, and they in turn are supporting discrimination in the workplace.  As we showed last night, Democrats will uphold the President's view, though, of this reckless and discriminatory legislation. 

I know some of you are interested in Puerto Rico.  We have a bipartisan agreement now, a bill that has been dropped.  Of course, it would not be the bill we had written, but it does contain a restructuring that can work, that calls for the board, the oversight board, to treat everyone equally and fairly.  And by that I mean pensioners and the rest, and it is not a bailout.  Contrary to the misleading -- God knows who is paying for them -- ads on TV that this is a bailout of Puerto Rico, it is not.  The White House, Speaker's office and our office and others participated in coming to an agreement, but, as I said, not the bill I would have written -- that goes without saying -- but a bill that we can support.  Others who would make their -- are reviewing the legislation, some of our Members who have been very interested in Puerto Rico.  The Ranking Member of the Natural Resources Committee, Mr. Grijalva, has been very thoughtful through this process.  And we hope -- what we would like to do is to act expeditiously in providing the President with the names of people to appoint to the board; that's the next step -- and we hope that we can move it quickly through committee markup, pass the legislation Puerto Rico so urgently needs. 

Do you have any questions?  Yes, ma'am.

Q:  Leader Pelosi, Donald Trump released a list of potential Supreme Court Justices.  What do you think of his releasing that list, and do you know about any of those

Leader Pelosi.  You know, to tell you the truth, Zika, opioids, Puerto Rico, the Defense bill, the bill that is on the floor now, nutrition, I haven't been paying attention to his list.  I'm so sorry.  I haven't had time for that.  Yes, sir.

Q:  Donald Trump said this morning that the EgyptAir crash, quote, ""looks like a terrorist attack.""  Do you believe that it was a terrorist attack and is there any evidence that you have seen or are aware of that would support that claim? 

Leader Pelosi.  No.  I don't think any of us know.  Right now, we are in a prayerful mode for the families who lost their loved ones, the tragedy of it all.  And I was hearing some of the experts, who do know about some of these things, on TV saying that we have to get more information to determine whether this is a mechanical malfunction or what.  The ""Hero of the Hudson"" was on this morning, and he was saying that when you are faced with a situation like that, the lowest priority is talking about what is going on.  You are addressing the issues.  So we just don't know. 

I certainly hope not, but as others have said, anything is possible, and we have to get more information.  So just acting upon no information, I am not going to go to that place. 

Yes, sir.

Q:  We've seen tension between the Sanders' campaign, the DNC, and the divided Democratic Party.  Just overheard from our folks here meeting with Donald Trump's representatives, they said, well, it looks like the Republicans are trying to coalesce around their candidate.  There's all of this dissidence in that trifecta of the DNC, the Democratic Party, and the Sanders side.  Does that contribute to greater dissidence on the Democratic side and how do you fix that? 

Leader Pelosi.  Well, welcome to the Democratic Party.  I have, as you probably know, been a State party chair, chaired the California Democratic Party, the largest party in the country.  I'm very proud to say that.  And the exuberance of our Members is always something wonderful to behold and, at some point, to channel.  The difference between what you are talking about here is just how -- within the family disagreement. 

But the distance in terms of issues and values and priorities between Hillary Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and Senator Sanders is like this compared to the chasm of difference between the Democrats and the Republicans on some of the issues I talked about: how we feed our children; how we address our public health issues; how we fund our opioids initiative, where we had bipartisan support; how we deal with Flint and what that means to children in our country.  Our values are very different, and they are reflected in our budget, and that's what the debate will be about. 

I think it's -- again, I have seen the exuberance of Democrats.  I condemn any violence that happens at any meeting, for sure.  One thing that I do want to reject, however, too, is I saw one show -- one of the early morning shows had harkening back to the 1968 convention.   I was at the 1968 convention.  I went with my Baltimore family, the D'Alesandros.  My brother was then the mayor of Baltimore in his 30s.  My father was a senior statesman and a big, ardent Humphrey supporter.  And it is nothing, I mean, to even suggest is really, I think, ridiculous -- nothing in common.  We were at war in Vietnam.  That fueled the unhappiness.  That matter was handled in a way that was not appropriate. 

But this is an incident.  That was a colossal coming together of people -- not coming together -- clashing of people who had completely a different view about the war and how we go forward. 

Q:  What is fueling this, though, in the Democratic Party?  You call it exuberance.  There was some violence, there were threats.

Leader Pelosi.  Yeah. 

Q:  But what's...

Leader Pelosi.  Well, here is the way I see it.  Again, harkening back to my own experience as a chairman and one who has -- you know, for 20 years, I served on the DNC -- my own view of some of this is that when you have a lot of new people who are attracted during a campaign -- and that's the beauty of a campaign, an ever&#8209;widening circle of people who now pay attention in a Presidential year.  Many of them are not familiar with what to expect.  And we all have a responsibility to try to make sure people know what to expect and what to expect is that there are rules that exist. 

For example, in Nevada, my understanding is that the chairs of the Credentials Committee were, one, a Bernie person and, one, a Hillary person.  But whatever was transmitted in the meeting did not allay the concerns of some who thought the calculation of delegates was not favorable enough to Bernie. 

But there is a responsibility that we all have to make sure people know, especially when they are coming in with such exuberance about issues they care about, their jobs, their economic security and the rest, that now has to be within a structure. 

Second, so, again, nothing to be surprising about people being disappointed about an outcome of a decision that the Party makes.  No excuse for any violence whatsoever.  Secondly, as you probably know, for at least 30 years, since this all began, I have been very much opposed to superdelegates.  I think it just makes people think:  Wait a minute; we are going through an elective process, and then you are telling me that 500 people in Washington, D.C., are going to weigh in at the end.  I really think that -- I have said this year in and year out, so this is nothing new -- that we should be revisiting the number of votes that superdelegates have.  Maybe give them a pass, maybe give them a pass to the hall or a seat on the floor, but not to undermine to make it look like there is something else that will weigh in after everyone goes through the electoral process. 

Is that more than you want to know on the subject? 

Q:  Madam Leader.  Madam Leader, can you tell us about the vote that's coming to the floor on the Confederate flag at veteran cemeteries? 

Leader Pelosi.  Yes, so, this, as I was watching the proceedings last night until 1 in the morning -- that is after the Golden State Warriors just raged -- just raged, right?  You are just looking very non-committal there.

Q:  It's one to one.  It's one to one. 

Leader Pelosi.  Okay.  Back to the seriousness of it.  I did watch the proceedings last night.  I saw that our colleague offered an amendment that said, that would say that there shouldn't be a Confederate flag on a veterans' cemetery, and it will come up for a vote today.

Q:  Did you feel you had to force the vote though?  Is it

Leader Pelosi.  No, no, this is an initiative by my colleagues.  Quite frankly, I thought most of those matters were dealt with on the Interior Committee.  If anybody had any interest in doing so, they could do it at Interior.  But apparently there is another category that falls under the Veterans' Affairs Committee.  So this is an initiative from the Members.  Any time you have hundreds of amendments on a Defense bill and then this bill all coming together, you have a lot of individual initiative. 

I certainly support what Congressman Huffman and his colleagues, co-sponsors Mr. [Ruben] Gallego and Mr. [Keith] Ellison, are putting forth.

Q:  Madam Leader, on Senator Sanders again.  Do you believe that he continues to be a positive support force in the party?

Leader Pelosi.  Yes.

Q:  And the campaign?

Leader Pelosi.  Absolutely. 

Q:  And do you have any concerns that with the anger of some of his supporters, it will be hard for him to bring them back into the fold, and does he have the responsibility to start doing that now or soon to get them behind Hillary? 

Leader Pelosi.  Well, I think that he will stay in the race.  Candidates do.  Senator Clinton did &#8209;&#8209; as Senator Clinton in 2008.  When we hosted the convention in San Francisco in 1984, you would have thought it was a Gary Hart convention, even though Walter Mondale was the nominee, because so many people came as Hart delegates and brought their enthusiasm, wanted to have their impact on the platform and the rules on how the party went forward. 

So I believe, again, rejecting any violence on the part of whomever was at that meeting, I believe that Bernie Sanders is a positive force in the Democratic Party.  He has awakened in some people an interest in the political process that wasn't there.  He has encouraged young people to channel their interest in public service and community leadership into a political place because this is where decisions are made that will affect their future, their lives, and I think that's all positive.

Q:  Leader Pelosi. 

Leader Pelosi.  Yes.  I'm going to have to go because they called the next vote.

Q:  The Senate Zika bill doesn't have -- the spending is not offset.  Are you hopeful that that's going to be possible in whatever compromise comes out of both chambers, and is that really what the fight is about, whether this money is offset?  It seems like Republicans agree that Zika is a problem. 

Leader Pelosi.  The problem is twofold.  I don't support the Senate initiative either because it's not enough.  People say, as I said to you last week, some of you last week, they said it's half a loaf.  No.  It's half a shoe.  You cannot get to where you need to be with half a shoe.  It's not half a loaf. 

In terms of what is needed for the public health emergency and the prevention, the vector control of mosquitos, et cetera, we need more resources.  In terms of the research in the House bill, NIH does better than the CDC but still doesn't have a complete funding to do the research. 

So there are two problems.  One, it's not enough, and two, in the House, it's coming out of other priorities, at the same time competing for funds for opioids.  We passed 18 bills on opioids.  Not one red cent.  But we have got to fund the opioids.  We have got to fund Zika.  We've got to do something about Flint.  And we have a budget agreement that was a compromise, so there isn't a lot of room for $3 billion more for opioids and Zika.  That has to be emergency spending.  So it would be two things.  It's not enough, and it should be emergency spending, just emergency supplemental, just as any other public health emergency would be. 

And I'm hopeful that as the public learns more about this, you have to get in front of an epidemic of this nature.  And this is freakish.  Just to let you know, just so you know, suppose you go someplace, Brazil, let's use Brazil, and you get bitten by the mosquito that carries the Zika virus, well, it is sexually transmitted.  We don't know for how long that capability exists in a person who is bitten.  You come home.  Another mosquito bites you -- garden variety mosquito -- that mosquito now is a Zika carrier.  So the proliferation of this is really something very different than we have seen in the past.  That is it is sexually transmitted it is new and different, and that it causes malformation in a developing fetus is stunning. 

So this is very big.  Why would you not get in front of it?  Why would you not make the investment that is going to be the humanitarian thing to do?  Honor our responsibilities in terms of public health and, by the way, save money in the outcome in the long run because you won't be spending $10 million for a lifetime to care for a child that probably won't be able to walk, talk, hear, or see, be malformed, and the tragedy of all of that, of course, is the biggest price to pay. 

So, again, it's about the budget.  What is it that they are saying?  You have got to go within the budget of Health and Human Services, which is a lamb&#8209;eat&#8209;lamb budget.  Everything in there is good.  You can't find -- it's very hard to find money to offset, much less big money to offset.  So we are just calling -- this is as important as it gets to the well&#8209;being of the American people.  Again, sounds like a lot of money when you hear it, but it's a small price to pay for the health and well&#8209;being of the American people.  Thank you all very much.",,,06/24/16 09:43 AM
26732,1096301,Transcript of Pelosi Press Conference Today,05/25/16,10,"Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi held her weekly press conference today.  Below is a transcript of the press conference.  

Leader Pelosi.  I'm just running a little bit late.  I just came from a memorial service for Harry Wu.  His passing in April took us all by surprise.  We were shocked and saddened by it. 

He was such a champion for human rights in China, always reminding us that we lose all moral authority to talk about human rights anywhere in the world if we do not talk about them in a place where we have a big commercial relationship, a place like China. 

He also reminded us constantly as he worked to spread the word about the Laogai, the labor camps where torture, hunger, and forced labor were the order of the day, and making products for sale in our own country.  He gave us evidence of that over and over again. 

What he said was -- he was a prisoner for 19 years -- the most excruciating form of torture by the prison guards to the prisoners was to tell them nobody even knows you're here, they don't even remember you, they don't know why you came here.  And for decades I had worked with him to make sure that the prisoners know that they are not forgotten. 

Harry will not be forgotten.  He will be sorely missed, Harry Wu. 

So tomorrow, May 26, we are leaving again, not to come back again until June 7, without doing the job the American people expect us to do.  I keep reading in the paper and see on TV about dysfunction in the Congress.  This isn't about dysfunction in the Congress, it's about dysfunction in the Republican Party.  It's about obstruction, reckless Republican obstruction of getting the job done for the American people. 

Republicans are blocking any action on the subject of Flint: Republicans are blocking any action, including yesterday's vote to block consideration of the Families of Flint Act to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water. 

On opioids, Republicans have voted twice to block the $600 million in fully paid for, vital new resources to address the opioid epidemic that kills 78 Americans every day. 

They passed all these number of bills, which are nice, but as I said to you before, that's a conversation.  What we need are the resources to implement the recommendations of the legislation that has passed here.  We'll go to conference, and hopefully the necessity to add resources to the words, money to the words. 

And this isn't about spending, it's about investing.  It's about saving lives, saving money, and saving families from the horror of the family member dying from the opioid epidemic. 

Zika.  If you knew about something that could be very dangerous to the population of your country, if you knew from scientists that there were some actions that needed to be taken in order to stop it, if you knew further that this epidemic was something so new and strange, that it was spread sexually, that the mosquitoes that spread it didn't even have to bite other people, just other mosquitoes could bite you and spread it, this is really an amazing thing. 

But most importantly, if you knew that being bitten by one of these mosquitoes, or another mosquito following up on it, your child would be born severely malformed, probably not be able to walk, talk, see, or hear, and that it would cost about $[10] million to care for that child, wouldn't you want to act upon that evidence?  Wouldn't you want to do everything in your power to prevent the American people, and honoring our responsibility to the world, to stop an epidemic of that nature?  You would, I think.  And we would need to act immediately, because the mosquito season, the hotter it gets, the worse it gets in terms of mosquitoes breeding and spreading the epidemic. 

Instead, we are in a conversation that is so unexplainable to anyone else, that we are going to take the money from Ebola, but it probably won't be ready until we finish the appropriation process, which could take months.  And by the way, we are leaving again for another, May 16 to June 7. 

I really call upon our friends in the media to be ambassadors for your own families, for your own children, for your own selves about this.  There is no way to explain, except the anti&#8209;science, anti&#8209;evidence, anti&#8209;data attitude that is rampant among the Republicans in Congress, that they would not act upon the best advice.

It's been how many, like 90&#8209;some days since the President asked for the funding for Zika?  How many days has it been, 87, something like that, since the President asked for this money for Zika?  And we have this process&#8209;oriented, I don't know what response to it.  But every day we could save more lives, and we have to, we have to act upon that. 

But as I say to all of you, you have a responsibility, too, to get the word out so that we can stop their obstruction of money to go forward, the investment that's going to save lives, save money, and save hardship for the American people.  Again, it's  more than 90 days between when the President submitted the emergency supplemental request to fight Zika.  This should be an emergency supplemental we bring to the floor, pass the bill, have scientists act upon this. 

Republicans, again, have had time for almost five weeks of recess in this spring period, no time to act on the crisis with the urgency and seriousness it deserves.  And now they are prepared, the Republicans, to close down Congress again from May 26 to June 7. 

Instead, House Republicans have been focused on a pesticide Trojan Horse bill, call it one thing, have it do another, reviving something they called the Zika Vector Control Act, a longstanding and really cravenly repackaged Republican effort to gut the Clean Water Act that will do nothing to protect Americans from Zika.  Just say the Freedom to Consume Pesticides Act for your children. 

They found time to strip D.C.'s budget autonomy, forcing the Republicans' dysfunction onto the people of D.C.  When Republicans can't pass a budget themselves, they want to force their dysfunction on the District of Columbia. 

They find time for their select panel to attack women, continuing a Republican campaign of misinformation and intimidation which has not been seen in Congress in, I will say it again, since the days of Joseph McCarthy.  I am so proud that yesterday 181 House Democrats called on Speaker Ryan to disband this panel. 

And then they have their systematic attack on the LGBT community, breaking their own procedures.  They are now saying that they are changing the rules, that you have to go up in advance and print it before someone can bring an amendment to the floor.  This is supposed to be an open rule.  So, again, what are they hiding?  What do they want to obstruct?  Again, obstruction.  Apparently want advance notice any time there is a vote about where they stand on LGBT bigotry. 

On Friday, I am so proud of our President, will again show the power of his moral courage when he visits Hiroshima.  I had the privilege when I was Speaker to go in 2008 to Hiroshima as part of the Speakers of the G8 countries, all of us plus -- then it was G8, and then plus the European Union Parliamentarian -- to lay a wreath at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. 

It's so in keeping with his work, his global leadership to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.  It's testimony to the U.S.&#8209;Japan friendship, which has been advanced by the relationship between President Obama and Prime Minister Abe.  I'm very proud that the President is doing that.

I'm pleased to take any questions.

***

Q:  Madam Leader, some of your colleagues in the Senate, through reports, have expressed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chairperson of the DNC is perhaps too toxic for that position.  A lot of are worried that she can't unify the party after what has been a very divisive primary.  Are you confident in the abilities of Debbie Wasserman Schultz to be the DNC chairperson? 

Leader Pelosi.  I put out a statement yesterday that said that Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz has the respect of her colleagues for her efforts and her leadership to unify the party and to win the election in November.

Q:  And for you as well? 

Leader Pelosi.  That was my statement.

Q:  Madam Leader, on the issue of Representative Maloney's amendment that he plans to reoffer on the Energy and Water bill, I wonder if Democrats see this as an opportunity to draw specific attention to another split within the Republican Party and force Republicans on the record specifically on this issue ahead of the election. 

Leader Pelosi.  No, I think it's an attempt on the part of the Democrats to honor what the President did.  I think the President, rightfully so, put forth, took his administrative action to make sure to end discrimination in terms of government contracting, and we support that.  And that's what Congressman Maloney's initiative is about. 

I'll be very honest with you, when he put it out the first time and then he announced plans to do it the second time, this is his initiative, his courage, and we support him in it.  But this isn't the plan of Democrats. 

Q:  What do you say about Republicans who worry about adding this onto the appropriations process complicates the ability to pass appropriations bills? 

Leader Pelosi.  Oh, my goodness, I'm so glad you asked that question.  They of the poison pills?  They of the so many poison pills that it's almost like an opioid?  I don't mean to make light of that.  It's almost its own epidemic of poison pills in the Congress.  They wouldn't think of saying that.  They would not think of saying that.  Well, you never know.  No, I don't think that's a legitimate thing for them to say.  That's what I think of it.

Q:  Madam Leader, I wanted to follow up on Luke's question here.  Look, the Sanders wing of the Democratic Party is really clashing with so&#8209;called the establishment wing.  Do you think Debbie Wasserman Schultz has done a proper job of sort of navigating that and quelling unnecessary conflict? 

Leader Pelosi.  I think that some of the unrest and unease that is out there among some people, and I don't see it as Bernie versus Hillary, I think it's just some unease that is out there, some of it spoken by one side or the other.  But there is unease about this election process. 

You don't want to go down this path with me because I have chaired a convention, I have chaired a host committee for a convention, I have chaired the Delegate Selection Compliance Review Commission, before your time, but that's really what's called the Delegate Selection Commission now.  I have chaired a platform.  I have done everything you could do for a convention.  And there is always unease in the ranks -- what's in the platform, how the delegates are selected, who calls the shots as to who gets seated.  That's part of the Democratic Party. 

I do think that this unease says that the Party should revisit the delegate selection process.

Q:  Right.  So has the chairwoman fallen short in her role

Leader Pelosi.  I don't know why we're spending so much time on the chair of the Democratic National Committee.  I don't know what the point is.  I haven't had the conversations with both Senators. 

I thought it was one Senator.  You're saying Senators.  I thought it was one Senator, who shall remain nameless.  I don't want to engage in a conversation about what one Senator, who shall remain nameless.  All I'm just saying is in our caucus we see a hard&#8209;working chairman. 

Now, I have been a long time, for 20 years, a member of the Democratic National Committee.  We thought we had some influence as to who would be the chairman of the party.  We know it's up to the nominee.  I think that this is not helpful in terms of unifying the party.

Q:  Madam Leader, on Medicare drug spending, the administration proposed a plan to deal with Medicare drug spending.  Some House Democrats wanted to join Republican efforts to kill that proposal.  Did you discourage House Democrats from signing on to that letter with Republicans? 

Leader Pelosi.  Well, we had a better path.  We had Richie Neal, who has been an expert on this subject for a long time, put forth another letter which really did address the situation.  And there is some education that needs to be done among all of us.  We can learn from each other on this subject about it. 

But you know what the point is.  The point is that nothing is increasing the cost of health care in our country more than the escalating cost of prescription drugs.  That is one place where we can do more.  We should have done more in the Affordable Care Act.  The Senate went its own way on that. 

It's a complicated issue, but now the administration is trying to contain the costs of prescription drugs and in a way that may or may not be understood fully by everyone, and that's what we have to meet and talk about.  Some hospitals are affected, but other hospitals are saying the cost of prescription drugs is what drives up their cost.  So this is a conversation we have to have. 

But one thing is for sure:  The cost of prescription drugs must be contained for the good health of the American people.

Q:  Madam Leader, you might not have seen the report from the State Department Inspector General, but it does raise some questions about whether or not Hillary Clinton should have had this server and so on.  Obviously, Republicans are piling on.  It does say that there are issues where she followed some of the same practices of previous Secretaries of State.

Leader Pelosi.  That's right.

Q:  But what is your take?  I mean, what are Republicans going to do with this issue, number one, and what should she have been doing in good conscience regardless of what the State Department rules?

Leader Pelosi.  Well, I think that Secretary Clinton did act in good conscience.  I haven't seen the report because it just came out this morning, but I do see a statement from the &#8209;&#8209; what I see in what you all are writing and also what the Government Reform Committee has said, and that is that what Secretary Clinton did was consistent with what other Secretaries of State have done, including Colin Powell.  The report itself references longstanding systemic weaknesses that go well beyond the tenure of any Secretary of State.

And she has released, by the way, she has released her emails.  The others have not. 

Yes, sir? 

Q:  On Zika, you have these two bills in two different chambers with two very different numbers.  A compromise was suggested that you would fall somewhere in&#8209;between.  I know you have said that even the higher number is not enough.  And you have said that is half a shoe, so it's unpalatable.  Is half a shoe not better than zero shoes?  I mean, what if you get nothing? 

Leader Pelosi.  Would you want to walk across anyplace with half a shoe?  You just can't do it.  People like to say half a loaf, oh, well, half a loaf.  No, you can't get there from here.  The administration asked for a number that had a scientific justification and urgency about it.  So for the Republicans to take it down to one&#8209;third of what the administration asked for is ridiculous.  And also to say it has to be paid for, take it from Ebola, take it from other things, that's just not right.  That's not good for the good health of the American people, and it's not a good investment that will ultimately save us money by keeping people well. 

In terms of the Senate, the 1.1, it's 1.9.  That's what the scientists tell us they need for prevention, for vector control, for research.  So why are we talking about a lower number?  And why are we talking about doing it in the appropriations process, which takes a long time?  Eighty&#8209;seven days, almost 90 days the President asked us.  We should have had an emergency supplemental which took this forward.  And now they're saying all this has to, you know, on the House side, all this has to come under the caps. 

To its credit, the Senate bill at least makes it emergency spending.  But it's not enough.  It's not enough.  So it's not a question of I'll low ball it and then we'll compromise somewhere in between so we'll get to, like, 40 percent of what we need.  It's just not right.  What is the justification for that?  What is the scientific justification for doing less than we need to do to protect the American people? 

They're telling people, women of child&#8209;bearing age, cover yourself up, go buy a mosquito net, cover yourself up with it all summer, wear long sleeves, long pants, and a mosquito net so that you don't get bitten by one of the Zika mosquitoes or another mosquito who bit somebody who was bitten by a Zika.  This is very dangerous, sexually transmitted.  Just to get right down into it, you don't know how long that Zika virus lives within the male of the species.  That means, gentlemen, [you here], and how long that could be sexually transmitted. 

This is very dangerous.  It's a small price to pay for the good health of the American people.  Why are we nickel and diming a request that can stop the malformation of babies conceived at this time?  Why are we nickel and diming that while we're giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country so it can trickle down maybe, special interest tax cuts in our tax code, when we are talking about the appropriate amount of money to get this done.

Q:  That all said, where is the leverage in your ""no"" vote if you oppose it?  I mean, you've got this bipartisan proposal in the Senate. 

Leader Pelosi.  Whatever that is, it's not going to happen for months.  Time is our leverage.  You are our leverage, the American people understanding what this is. 

We don't want to be fearmongers, we don't want people to be frightened.  But the scientists are telling us the mosquitoes are coming, the Zika virus is coming.  It's a virus transmitted by a mosquito.  This is a whole sexually transmitted and causing malformation in babies.  This is a big challenge. 

And say the money, we're even, and they said we're going to give you all the money you want in October.  What?  Why?  How do we expect to meet our responsibilities to the American people? 

Anything?  

Q:  Leader Pelosi, I just want to follow up on the discussion about the DNC chair, because it is more than just one Democratic Senator, it's both campaigns now acknowledging

Leader Pelosi.  I don't know about that. 

Q:  Well, having the Congresswoman in that role, they're saying, is complicating their efforts to unite the party.  Fair or not

Leader Pelosi.  Both campaigns are saying that?

Q:  CNN is reporting it.  Fair or not about whether

Leader Pelosi.  I'm not aware of that.  I can't answer a question on something I'm not aware of. 

Q:  But if she is perceived to be not necessarily being fair, doesn't it hurt the party's efforts to unite, and isn't it time to put somebody in the role that both sides can accept? 

Leader Pelosi.  Let me just say this.  We've got Zika, we've got Puerto Rico, we just finished with TSCA last night, which a million phone calls all weekend.  We're trying to do the appropriations bill where we come to a beautiful agreement in a bipartisan way until they pile their poison pills in. 

We on the Democratic side are trying to impact in a positive way for the American people what is happening here and to stop some of the dangerous proposals they have put forth in terms of pesticides in the water for our children, not adequately responding to Zika, et cetera. 

I don't spend a whole lot of time on the Democratic Party politics.  I haven't even gotten myself involved in the Presidential.  So I'm not a good person to ask about this. 

But I do know that what is going to unify our party, just as it unifies the Democrats in the House, is the values that we share, the concern that we have for the well&#8209;being of the American people, that we are here to win the election, elect a Democratic President and Congress, so that we can give the leverage back to working families in our country.  Give them the leverage instead of having it be always a trickle down at the mercy of the high end. 

And this is about campaign finance reform to reduce the role of money in politics.  This is about truly addressing the costs of higher education and addressing the needs of those who are carrying high interest rates.  It's about protecting Dodd&#8209;Frank from the daily assault that is made on it here to weaken it.  It's about staving off attempts by some who would like to take us back to September 2008 when we had the serious meltdown as a result of the policies of the Bush administration, which they were trying to keep from the American people until a new President was elected and blame it on the new President. 

So we have important challenges here that this election is about.  I'm not going to get involved in conversations about personality.  I told you that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has the respect of her colleagues in the House for her hard work to unify and to win the elections.  The Democratic National Committee and the nominee of the party decide who will be the next chairman of the party. 

I would suggest, as one who has some experience in the party, that they take a look instead at what the unease is about, and the unease is about how delegates have been selected and what weight they have. 

And just to give you a little tidbit, for 30 years I have been against superdelegates.  So that's my thinking on the subject. 

In any event, I have to get back to work before we leave here again, but we will be working over the break to try to inform the American people. 

And by the way, this is not about Democrats versus Republicans.  This is about Congress doing the right thing by our responsibilities to the American people, for example, on Zika, on opioids, on Flint.  These challenge us to do the right thing, to make investments that save money and save lives.  We are determined to get that done. 

I hope you can help us, especially on the Zika -- I mean, all of them are equally important.  The Zika is growing, and we have to put a stop to that.  I'm very, shall we say, concerned, I'm concerned about it. 

Thank you all very much.

Q:  Not crowing about the Warriors.  Did you talk to the Appropriations subcommittee chair, Tom Cole?

Leader Pelosi.  I'm a believer.  I'm a believer.  I'm a believer.  I'm a believer.  I'm a believer.

Q:  Thank you.  

Leader Pelosi.  Thank you.",,,06/24/16 10:09 AM
26732,1096313,Transcript of Pelosi Press Conference Today,06/09/16,10,"Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi held her weekly press conference today.  Below is a transcript of the press conference.  

Leader Pelosi.  Good morning, everyone.  It's still morning.  My apologies for running late.  I just came from a very invigorating session with the Democratic Party Platform Drafting Committee.  I went there to talk about the Innovation Agenda 2.0.  Under the leadership of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, our Members have had sessions across the country on innovation. 

As some of you may recall, 10 years ago, we had the Innovation Agenda, which we passed into law and created the Competitiveness Act, which contained ARPA-E and so many other initiatives for innovation. 

Recognizing that innovation begins in the classroom, a strong part of our agenda is about investing in education, which, by the way, helps to reduce the deficit because nothing brings more money to the Treasury than investing in education from earliest childhood, K through 12, higher education, post-grad, lifetime learning for our workers. 

It was pretty exciting -- the fact is the world is going digital.  America must continue to be number one.  In the spirit of John F. Kennedy, he said, ""Under the vows of our Nation, we must be first, and therefore we intend to be first, when announcing the moonshot.""  That was the inspiration for so much innovation in our country. 

But it keeps happening; technology keeps moving.  And, as they say where I live in northern California: you ain't seen nothing yet.  So this is happening.  It's inevitable.  It's important for us.  Other countries are becoming digital.  It's important for America to be number one.  We are excited about it. 

In our Innovation Agenda 1, 10 years ago, 22 of our platforms -- this was nonpartisan, it was academic, businesspeople, labor and workers, every aspect of an economy and society weighing in in a nonpartisan way -- 22 recommendations.  Only one of them failed to become law, comprehensive immigration reform, which is really central to, again, the invigoration of America, having the best possible talent educated here, to stay here, to work here, as we train our own workforce.  Comprehensive immigration reform, so many reasons we must pass it, still to be done.  But that's what I did this morning, and I'm very excited about it. 

At the same time, Republicans' reckless obstruction has been going on on display.  Two days after rolling out their so-called ""poverty agenda"" that will make life harder for struggling families, they are releasing their national security plank today, desperately trying to distract the American people. 

House Republicans will have to answer why they want to hand the nuclear codes to a man who explodes at the slightest provocation, who wants to ignite a nuclear arms race in Asia, and who wants to undermine our multilateral security with NATO, to name a few.

Republicans are twisting in the wind over what our very own Speaker calls Trump's ""textbook racist attack"" on Judge Curiel.  But there is not a dime's worth of difference, as I've said to you before, between what Donald Trump said and what the House Republicans have said.  Republicans have comfortably surrendered to their new standard bearer, to his dangerous discrimination agenda, because it's an agenda that House Republicans have shared. 

Instead of acting upon the concerns of the American people, creating good paying jobs, decent paychecks, and the rest, this is what the Republicans are doing.  On the floor of the House, they are trying to require the Library of Congress to use dehumanizing terms when it comes to referring to undocumented immigrants in our country. 

At the same time, we have been beseeching them, begging them -- it has been over 108 days since the President asked for the emergency supplemental.  Republicans voted seven times to block the President's $1.9 billion request. 

On opioids, Republicans voted twice to block the $600 million in fully paid for vital new resources to address the opioid epidemic that kills 78 Americans a day.  This is happening all over America, including in their districts. 

Flint, it's hard to get their attention on Flint.  It challenges the conscience of our country, and yet we still haven't acted upon that. 

Instead, we're too busy on the floor trying to encourage the Library of Congress to use dehumanizing terms.  So the Republicans will try to, but they cannot, hide their radicalism and their discrimination from the American people. 

Yesterday, they announced -- the Speaker announced -- his Rules Committee, they're going to ban even the pretense of regular order.  Just shows how afraid they are of people speaking on the floor of the House. 

Last month, the Republicans voted down their own appropriations bill.  You know why?  Because it contained protections for LGBT Americans.  It's long been clear that the regular order is not as important to the Republicans as protecting their special interest agenda, which includes discrimination.  Too bad. 

But, again, we have important work to do.  I'm hopeful about what will happen on Puerto Rico.  That should be imminent, and we look forward to finishing that off today or tomorrow. 

Yes, sir.

***

Q:  Madam Leader, there is obviously a lot of talk about Bernie Sanders today, his meetings with the President, with Harry Reid.  Is there something unique about Senator Sanders and/or his campaign or his supporters?  We've had other presidential campaigns and people, you know, get to a certain point when it's obvious they can't win, and they drop out.  And I don't mean this in a negative sense, but the idea there's something, there's some fire he caught on to that makes it tougher for him to get out and maybe help get the party overall to be unified behind Hillary Clinton.  What's unique about the circumstances of him and his supporters in this case? 

Leader Pelosi.  I don't know if I would use the word ""unique"" because, again, everything is different.  Hillary Clinton's campaign, up until the day of the election, or the day after the election in California -- 8 years ago Hillary Clinton was still in the race.  There is another event happening next week here in Washington, D.C.'s process.  My understanding is that Senator Sanders wants to be respectful of the process until the end, until the people have spoken. 

There's no question that he has captured -- again, I use the word ""invigorated"" -- the process with the people that he has brought in, an ever widening circle of young people who have been physically involved, community-oriented, but not particularly politically interested.  He has shown them a path with his plan for reducing the cost of college, addressing the egregious actions of Wall Street, and, again, the big umbrella issue that affects everything, campaign finance reform, overturning Citizens United. 

So, it's hard.  As everyone knows, it's very hard.  People have their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations riding on a candidate.  And sometimes it's really harder for the supporters to come to a reconciliation than it is for the candidate. 

Bernie Sanders knows what's at stake in this election, what's on the line.  I have no doubt that he will be very constructive as we go forward.  I also know it's very hard not to win, and it's hard for your supporters especially.

Q:  Is it tougher for him, though?  You said it's harder for the supporters, but is there, again, something    use whatever word you want -- special or unique about Sanders that's harder for him to come to terms and that reconciliation that he can't win? 

Leader Pelosi.  Well, I hope not because if there is any uniqueness or specialness in this situation, it is certainly offset by the Republican nominee for President of the United States, Donald Trump. 

But let me just say, you know, my history with all of this.  I have been involved in every kind of way.  I've chaired a platform committee, I've chaired a convention, I've chaired the delegate selection rules stuff and all of that.  But in 1976, I went with Jerry Brown to the convention.  That was my coming out of the kitchen and beginning my road to the Congress, I guess.  But in 1976 we went, and we were lobbying people for Jerry Brown, thinking something could happen with the Carter candidacy and we'd be ready.  In 1980, you know what happened at the convention; it was Kennedy and Carter.  In 1984, I chaired the host committee for the convention in San Francisco.  You would've thought it was a Gary Hart convention -- the number of signs, the enthusiasm of the delegates and the rest, but Walter Mondale was the nominee. 

Again, the list goes on.  In terms of 1992, I was chairing the platform committee, and my friend Jerry Brown was running against Bill Clinton and took his fight to the convention.

So it goes on.  And what's hard for some people -- I know, in 2008, they came to me and said, ""Do I really have to vote for Barack Obama?  I'm so committed to Hillary Clinton.""  I said, ""Yeah, well, that's a decision you have to make,"" and they made their own decisions.  But, still, it's hard. 

So it's always hard, and people are always hopeful.  And every candidate thinks he or she is going to win.  That's why they run, or to get their message out. 

And so the question is:  What is the purpose, going forward?  I think that Bernie Sanders has really done a great job for our country, for our democracy, certainly for the Democratic Party and for young people.  Now, what's the next step?  That's really up to him.

Q:  Just to follow up on that

Leader Pelosi.  Okay.  We can talk politics all day, and I have been all morning, so

Q:  I'm sure.  But just to follow up on that

Leader Pelosi.  And then we'll come to immigration. 

Q:  Just to follow up on that, Bernie Sanders' campaign is still being pretty adamant that he's going to take this to the convention.  Are you comfortable with that idea? 

Leader Pelosi.  He has to make his own decisions.  I just described to you several conventions that I was involved in where the candidate took it to the convention, whether it was Ted Kennedy, whether it was Jerry Brown on more than one occasion, whether it was -- Gary Hart was not actually -- he was thinking in terms of the future when he took his forces to the convention.  But people -- candidates do.  And I think that Bernie Sanders should not be -- while you point out the specialness and perhaps uniqueness of the movement he has created, he knows what's on the line.  And he should be treated no differently than other candidates.  He should be allowed the opportunity and respected to have the opportunity to make his decision about how he brings this to a place that advances the causes that he has been fighting for.

Q:  On immigration reform, it's an issue in the election.  So do you think that the U.S.&#8209;Mexico border is secure? 

Leader Pelosi.  I think it's important to note that I just took a delegation, a bipartisan delegation, to Mexico, and migration was one of the issues -- TPP, national security always first and foremost the issue.  And the fact is that we have a negative migration.  More people are going back to Mexico than are coming into our country. 

And the idea of building a wall there, a barrier rather than a bridge -- anyone familiar with the region -- and I am to a certain extent.  Been there many times, to El Paso or Laredo or McAllen, all those places along the border.  Go to El Paso.  It's a community with a border running through it.  People come back and forth and buy their groceries, see their families, some go to school.  It is a beautiful site to behold, I have to say.  So the thought of building a wall there is wrong.  And the people in Mexico have concerns about what that means, in terms of disrespect for them. 

But I don't see many people writing about the fact that there are more people going back to Mexico than coming into the United States. 

Yes, ma'am.

Q:  On the Puerto Rico legislation, are you confident the rule and the bill can pass?  And what does the Democratic support look like at this point? 

Leader Pelosi.  Well, you know, this morning, you probably saw that Nydia Velázquez and -- Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez and Congressman José Serrano put out statements in support of the legislation. 

I think it's important to note that what is in the bill to help Puerto Rico restructure is very important and very well thought out and represents a compromise in terms of the board that will do the oversight.  And we want to make sure that people who are appointed to the board have the best interest of the restructuring working. 

On another day and another bill, it is important for us to recognize things that we couldn't put in this bill, just would not have worked at this time.  And that would go to issues like Medicaid, earned income tax credit, issues like that which do help the island and its economic recovery. 

But we'll see what the vote is.  People are, sort of, very affected by what Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez and José Serrano have to say, so I feel pretty good about its passage.

Q:  You're a longtime appropriator, or used to be, so you probably can figure out how Hal Rogers is viewing the Zika negotiations.  It seems like the upper limit for funding would be the Senate figure at 1.1.  It also seems like the House will insist on offsets.  Is that a formula that might get some House Democratic votes, or would you simply

Leader Pelosi.  Well, let's say this.

Q: not accept offsets? 

Leader Pelosi.  First of all, when the Senate put forth its, I think unfortunate, $1.1 billion proposal, the Democrats who supported it justified that by saying it's not offset.  So it's not a lamb&#8209;eat&#8209;lamb situation, you're taking money for Zika from other initiatives that are good for the health and well&#8209;being of the American people.  Again, that's what we used to call it on our committee, Labor&#8209;HHS: lamb&#8209;eat&#8209;lamb.  There's almost no place to go to get some funding because everything is a priority. 

As I was on the Appropriations Committee, I understand the culture, but I think that the easiest thing -- the most important thing they could have done was to fund, under emergency funding, the full request of President Obama.  I hope that that is what they will eventually do. 

But, you know, this is not a compromise of a compromise, it's a -- the first thing was a compromise, and now we're going backward.  So it's really unfortunate.  And we need the $1.9 billion.  Now, let's see where they come down. 

But I feel sorry a little bit for Mr. Rogers because I know he cares about opioids.  He should care about Flint.  The whole world cares about Zika.  And their process seems to be oblivious to the urgency of all three of them. 

So I don't have -- I just think they're long overdue.  An emergency bill could have passed -- we're over 100 days since the request -- could've passed.  It could have been well down the road to what needs to be done in terms of prevention, in terms of research and the other aspects of stopping the epidemic.

Q:  Madam Leader, on appropriations, given Republicans' move to a structured rule on appropriations, what's the game plan for Democrats on how or whether to support spending measures on the floor?  I mean, Republicans are blaming Democrats for the move to a structured rule, and they say they've concluded most of your Members will vote against appropriations. 

Leader Pelosi.  Well, first of all, let's just say, again, getting back to the culture of appropriations, we always strove -- is it ""strove"" or ""strived""?  We had striven -- attempted to -- we always worked in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that could pass on the floor that was the best we could do under what we had to work with.  In the '90s, under Newt Gingrich of course, they tried to use appropriations as a poison&#8209;pill vehicle, and that's some of what we're living with now. 

So whether people vote for the bill or not will have more to do about the substance of the bill, whether it has poison pills or whether it is the bill that was negotiated by the Republicans and Democrats on the committee before the dose of medicine came down from the Leadership on the poison pill.  So it all depends on the bill. 

The fact that they -- this is a longstanding tradition, you might even call it a source of pride, right?  Of having open rules for appropriations bills.  The fact that they are now closing down that option is a sign of fear and cowardice on their part.  They are afraid of the debate. 

You saw what happened -- let me just close by this.  You saw what happened last week.  They had their own bad bill, Energy and Water, which met their standards.  It was so bad that even their own people accepted it.  And yet over 300 people voted against the bill because it had a measure in it to stop discrimination against LGBT contractors who received Federal contracts. 

Imagine that they would say; even this terrible bill, which pollutes and -- it's one of their specialties.  It was such a bad bill.  But even how bad it was and how polluting and degrading of the environment that it was, it wasn't bad enough for them to accept something that said the President's Executive order that said that LGBT contractors should not be discriminated, [against] those who have Federal contracts. 

It's stunning.  It's stunning.  It's not surprising.  It's typical.  And it's completely in keeping with Donald Trump.  That's why I said there's not a dime's worth of difference between the two of them.  It's really sad, and I don't paint all the Republicans with the same brush.  But enough of them to vote against any bill that would have anything about discrimination of LGBT. 

I remind you, I remind you, I remind you -- are you ready to hear?  That in 2010, when the defense authorization bill was on the floor and we had the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell' in the bill and the amendment passed, only nine Republicans voted for the defense authorization bill.  Only nine Republicans.  Now, do you ever hear them criticize us for voting against the defense bill?  But they did if it ended discrimination against LGBT people.  So this is an ongoing thing. 

And did you tell me?  Who was it who told me that in their meeting, where they opened with a prayer, which I fully respect and said we do, that whoever was leading the prayer said to the Members that the people who voted for the Maloney -- the [Rep.] Sean Patrick [Maloney] bill would -- did he say burn in hell or just go to hell for voting for that amendment that ended discrimination?  This is what we're dealing with. 

So, interesting times.

Q:  What's wrong with Steph Curry? 

Leader Pelosi.  He'll be back.  Last question you asked me was, when we were down three to one and you were like -- and I said one word to you:  Believe. 

Q:  You said it five times.  You sounded like Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees.  ""I'm a believer."" 

Leader Pelosi.  They're having their anniversary. 

Thank you.",,,06/24/16 10:18 AM
26732,1096377,Transcript of Pelosi Press Conference Today,06/16/16,10,"Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi held her weekly press conference today.  Below is a transcript of the press conference.  

Leader Pelosi.  Good afternoon.  I'm sorry.  We had, what, 28 votes?  Pretty exciting, right?  Thank you all for being here. 

It's such a very sad time.  Early in the morning on Sunday, we lost all of these people who we will carry in our hearts.  So young, so young, representing the beautiful diversity of our country, and targeted.  Victims of [a] hate crime.  No question about that.  Again, we stand with Orlando. 

Every time something like this happens, there's a very big expression of concern.  We go to the floor of the House.  We have a moment of silence.  And that moment of silence is indicative of what will follow:  Silence.  No real legislation, no action to address the concerns that were brought to the floor again this Sunday. 

But since Sunday, as tragic and horrible as that massacre, that hate crime was, since Sunday, more than 100 people have been killed by gun violence in our country.  So this is a daily, ongoing challenge to our oath of office to protect and defend the American people, our Constitution, our national security, our homeland security, personal security of the American people. 

And yet, every time this happens, again, we have a moment of silence.  And today, we did that one better, and that is to have a legislative moment of silence by having a bill which was a captured bill that had already passed the Congress, which are okay bills, but they don't really address the problem, and they have already passed the House.  So why are they bringing it up again except to look as if they are taking some action? 

We have had some meetings since all of this happened to mobilize the concern of the American people to have an impact on what happens here in Congress.  We salute Senator Chris Murphy, take pride in the fact that he first served in the House, and his stamina and his commitment, until he got a promise for votes to continue his filibuster on the Senate side. 

But we cannot, I don't know how we can allow another tragedy, massacre to occur.  With little children we thought for sure, over and over again, we thought for sure, this one more time.  Well, we have to make sure this one more time, that a massacre of this kind doesn't happen again, but in doing so to recognize that part of our purpose is to make sure guns are not in the hands of people who shouldn't have them and stop the massacre that is happening on the streets of our country every single day. 

And that's why we are focusing on ""No Fly, No Buy'.  If you are not able to fly because you are on an FBI ""No Fly' list, or have been on one, then if you are on it, you shouldn't be able to buy a gun.  If you had been on one, we hope that the legislation will indicate that that information would go to the FBI so they can see that someone who had been on a no&#8209;fly list is now purchasing a gun. 

And both of these have bipartisan support in the country and in the Congress.  Eighty&#8209;seven percent of the American people say ""No Fly, No Buy', except for the Republican Members of the Congress of the United States. 

On the other bill that was bipartisan, [Congressman] Peter King of New York and [Congressman] Mike Thompson of California, who have been working on gun safety for a long time together, put together a bipartisan bill on background checks, one that was similar to what was put on the floor in the Senate and close to being passed there.  They need 60 votes. 

And so this is our focus, ""No Fly, No Buy', background checks which will prevent more gun violence than almost anything that you can do.  There's certainly enthusiasm in our Caucus for issues that relate to what we passed before the assault weapon ban, but we did that in a Democratic Congress.  I don't see how, I don't know that this Congress can do that. 

But I do know that if they brought ""No Fly, No Buy' and if they brought the background check bill to the floor these would pass.  And we would hope that people would recognize that nothing is more eloquent to a Member of Congress than the voice of his or her own constituents, and understand that. 

It is just another in a series, though.  When we had the moment of silence there was not even a recognition that this was a hate crime targeting the LGBT community.  That's why people get really upset with these moments of silence because there are a moment of silence without the recognition of what we are having a moment of silence for. 

So, while we are not protecting the American people with gun safety legislation, we are also not protecting them, once again here we are gathered to say, 115 days since the President asked for an emergency supplemental for Zika.  Almost 2,200 Americans have confirmed Zika cases; more than 400 pregnant women.  House Republicans have voted seven times to block the request of the President of what was needed. 

In terms of opioids, the Republicans voted twice to block the $600 million to fully pay for new vital resources to address the opioid epidemic.  It kills 78 Americans every day.  It's happening in every district in the country.  That gives me some hope that in addition to passing legislation, which we have done, but it has no money, and it's therefore not enforceable. 

In Flint, poor Flint, it's so hard to keep calling your attention and leadership in the Congress's attention, of a Republican majority, to Flint.  It challenges the conscience of America that these children would be subjected to that poisonous water affecting their brain and their futures.  And there are answers, there are answers, but it takes some resources.  And, by the way, we are saying Michigan should match the resources. 

All of these things are an investment, but it's going to end up costing less in the long run, or even in the short run.  Prevention, addressing the needs of the children in Flint, putting the funding with the policy on opioids, all of that will save us money because they are good investments. 

So here we are, another day, another resistance to doing what we need to do to protect and defend the American people. 

Any questions? 

Q:  Madam Leader, you talked about spending lots of money.  We are trying to follow this story with Medicaid fraud and improper payments, and it looks like by now it's probably double what it was just 3&#8209;1/2 years ago, the amount of fraud, close to 11 percent.  Is there anything Congress can do to counteract that and to do a better job of accounting? 

Leader Pelosi.  Well, there are two things.  Improper payment means there was some technicality in the payment.  Fraud is another thing.  Both have to be corrected, but they are not synonymous. 

Waste, fraud, and abuse, we go after that everyplace, and the Obama Administration has taken very substantive steps to reduce fraud and abuse in both Medicaid and Medicare, and we are trying to get some resources to put back in Medicare and Medicaid.  The Affordable Care Act gave the CMS more tools to comprehensively address these issues and it was an important part of the Affordable Care Act.  Fraud, no, I don't think so. 

So the tools that we put in the bill have already saved the taxpayer $1.4 billion. 

In terms of the improper statement, the vast majority of improper payment cases, beneficiaries are receiving the services they need from legitimate providers, but there has to be some better accounting for it.  Using that statistic is misleading to the public because it isn't intentional fraud, it is just a mistake in the vast bureaucracy.

Q:  Thank you.  I stand corrected.  Is there anything lawmakers can do, though, to improve that accounting? 

Leader Pelosi.  Well, we did in the Affordable Care Act, to give them the tools to comprehensively address all of these issues and that's happening.  And the administration has taken steps to reduce that.   

But, no, it's important.  We have to subject every dollar of the taxpayers that is spent to the most intense scrutiny.  Any of us who have been supportive of initiatives that help people, like Medicare and Medicaid, are the most critical that every dollar is spent in the most effective way and that no taxpayer dollar is wasted.

Thank you.

Q:  Madam Leader, so Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders met this week?

Leader Pelosi.  Yes.

Q:  I have asked you a few times about the divisions within the party.  Based on where we stand now, we are through the entire process with Washington voting on Tuesday, Washington, D.C.  Where are we now?  What needs to happen at this stage to get those two wings of the party together going into the convention and the election?

Leader Pelosi.  I think the unity of the Democratic Party springs from our values that we all know.

Q:  You say it as though it's there, though.

Leader Pelosi.  Oh, yeah. 

Q:  Do you think it is there?

Leader Pelosi.  No question, no question. 

Now, is everything unanimous?  It's very rare to have anything be unanimous in the Democratic Party.  That's why we are the Democratic Party with a capital ""D"" and a small ""d."" 

Well, first of all, fresh off of our elections a week ago in California, we really raged in terms of what we needed to do being in the top two.  We have a different system in California.  I don't like it, but it's a different system.  But nonetheless, we raged.  We have the Democrats where they need to be for the general election. 

And I think that's thanks to a vigorous primary campaign by Secretary Clinton and by Senator Sanders, and I've told you that before.  That gave us so much hope and turned out so many people.  That is what is going to happen in what comes next.  Bernie Sanders is one of the people who knows better than anyone what's on the line in this election and that unity is important. 

And it's also important for us to recognize the revitalization that he has brought -- the invigoration, I should say, he has brought, and all the people he has brought to the fore.  And some of the priorities he has, campaign finance reform, it's always been our priority.  So review delegate selection rules -- those kinds of things.  Why not? 

So, I don't think that so many of these things are difficult.  They may not all be addressed and finished yet, but none of them -- the difference that we have among us all between the two candidates is nothing compared to the chasm between us and the Republicans.  And the more every day when presumptive nominee Trump speaks unifies the Democrats more.

Q:  Madam Leader -- on that point -- Senator Sanders did say that he would like to see Debbie Wasserman Schultz replaced at the head of the DNC.  Hillary Clinton did not close the lid on that by any means.  What are your thoughts about Senator Sanders suggesting that?

Leader Pelosi.  Well, as a member -- I'm ex-officio, I guess now as Leader, but I was on the DNC for a long time before I came to Congress.  And we took great pride in being the ones who voted for who would be the chair of the DNC.  So if you want to know who is going to be chair of the DNC, I think you should look to the membership of the Democratic National Committee.

Q:  Should she step aside, though, as Senator Sanders is suggesting?

Leader Pelosi.  Again, who is the Chair of the Committee is up to the members of the Democratic National Committee.  Quite frankly, I haven't seen the full list of Senator Sanders' request, and I don't know how much weight he places on each of them.  But I think if we could have comprehensive campaign finance reform, that's worth everything, because that makes all the difference in the world as to what happens in public policy.

Q:  Madam Leader? 

Leader Pelosi.  Yes, sir.

Q:  Will curtailing the Second Amendment rights of Americans to keep and bear arms protect this country from radical Islamic terrorism?

Leader Pelosi.  Are you stipulating to the fact that there's some urge not to honor the Second Amendment? 

Q:  Well, no, I'm referencing the bill that's currently on the House floor -- well, the Senate floor, the filibuster.

Leader Pelosi.  Well, that's not curtailing the Second Amendment.  That's not pertaining to the Second Amendment at all.  The Second Amendment is like every other amendment.  It, as in the Heller decision from the Supreme Court, can be clarified. 

Just as my colleague Mr. Clyburn is always saying: the First Amendment right is something we all cherish, but doesn't enable you to cry ""fire"" in a theater, or if you're in the press to libel people.  There are standards. 

And the same thing with the Second Amendment, as the Supreme Court said in the Heller decision, affirming that the Second Amendment is a right to bear arms, but that actions can be taken in relation to it. 

And to say that if you think, if you're stating that if you can't buy -- if you're on a Terrorist Fly list, you should be able buy guns or else we are curtailing somebody else's right to bear arms, then I don't subscribe to that.  And I don't think most people do.  Eighty seven percent of the American people say: pass 'No Fly, No Buy'.  Some percent of those are Republicans; some of them are members of the NRA. 

So I don't think it has anything to do with the Second Amendment.  I think it has everything to do with our oath of office to keep the American people safe.

Q:  But do you think that the right to keep and bear arms helps protect Americans from terrorism?

Leader Pelosi.  I think that what we saw in Orlando is a coming together of national security, homeland security, and gun safety.  And I don't see a relationship to unfettered, let people who are on a No-Fly list buy a gun is in furtherance of the national security of our country.

Yes, sir.

Q:  Madam Leader, how optimistic are you that some sort of gun control legislation passes as a result of this attack?

Leader Pelosi.  It's up to the American people, because, as I have said, what we're talking about, there are many other things.  For example, there is legislation that Mr. Cicilline has that says: if you have been convicted of a hate crime, that you shouldn't be able to buy a gun.  There are other, in fact, in terms of ""No Fly, No Buy', how the FBI is informed.  If somebody had been on the No-Fly list and is not on the No-Fly list and they buy a gun, the FBI should be informed. 

So, what we are talking about is so simple, it's so commonsensical, that I think the Republicans are going to have to explain to the American people why they are just plain hand maidens of the National Rifle Association and the Gun Owners of America, why, as I said to you yesterday, or was it the day before, that they are a wholly owned subsidiary of the NRA, the Republicans in Congress. 

So, they are going to take four votes on Monday.  We will see where it comes down.  What Chris Murphy fought for yesterday was a vote on ""No Fly, No Buy' and on background checks legislation, both of which have over two thirds of the American people supporting them. 

And I'm optimistic, if the American people weigh in, that anything is possible, because we are Representatives and we should be representing that point of view in our country. 

I think we have enough time for one more, because I have to go. 

Q:  So in the aftermath of the Orlando shooting, specifically, Madam Leader, the gun issue is one part of this.  But you have had your briefings with law enforcement.  I'm sure you have had others yourself.  Where, if anywhere, have you seen in your briefings and in the information that you have gotten might the FBI have either fallen short on the surveillance or apprehension of this assailant, either in terms of their own activities or in terms of the authority that they might need? 

On the law enforcement side, are Democrats, are you and other Democrats going to be willing to support -- I'm sure more money -- but broader authority for either keeping these cases open for longer?  He was on a list and then he was taken off of it, as we all know.  There are some gray areas there.  Have you seen any law enforcement specific areas that you think might have to change here?

Leader Pelosi.  It will be up to the FBI to do after action review to see what they recommend.  But one of the changes that we are talking about, even before Sunday, was that if you're on a no fly list and you come off and you try to buy a gun, it should be there that you had been on a No-Fly list and that the FBI should be informed that you're buying a gun.  You can still buy the gun, but the FBI would be informed that you are buying the gun.  I think that would be very important. 

They have protected us, the FBI has protected us from so much in our country, and when something like this happens, of course, you have to do an after action review to see what could have avoided this or, in addition to that, how do we learn from this to protect, to make sure it doesn't happen again. 

But I think I can say with confidence in terms of what I have been briefed that we owe a great deal to the Bureau for what they have done to protect us.  They have to act within the constraints of the Constitution as well, and so it comes back to our debate of security and civil liberties.  And, again, our first responsibility is to defend and protect the American people. 

But this is a terrible tragedy.  It was somebody who was a regular, a frequenter of this place, somebody familiar to them, someone who had made anti-gay, LGBT statements, clearly a hate crime.  Now, how much of it was hate crimes and how much of it was inspired or justified or rationalized by ISIS or whatever, I don't know.  But we do know that it was a hate crime and we do know that it was horrible.

Q:  Would you have liked to -- forgive me, there may not be an answer to this in retrospect that is of any quality -- but would you have liked to have seen law enforcement have more of an ability to keep tabs on this guy either more closely or to arrest him at an earlier point since they had interacted with him on so many occasions?

Leader Pelosi.  Well, it depends on what evidence they had.  They had him in their sights.  You know, they had him in their sights. 

Now, what is required by the law to surveil or apprehend someone, we have to review.  But if this is an act of terrorism, which it is domestic terrorism, if it's other terrorism as well, the goal of terrorists is to instill fear.  That's their goal, is to instill fear.  They put no value on life.  We see that.  So that doesn't really matter to them.  But to instill fear.  And if that fear changes the character of our country, then they will have succeeded. 

So we, again, always have to address the balance of our civil liberties and the need, the responsibility we have to protect and defend.  But looking at the bigger picture, we owe the Bureau a great deal of thanks for what they have prevented happening in our country.

Thank you all very much.",,,06/24/16 10:41 AM
53306,1096494,Press Availability at NATO Headquarters,05/19/16,10,"Good afternoon, everybody. I'm personally very pleased to be back in Brussels, which I have come to understand, as many people in the world have, is a city of remarkable strength and resilience. And I'm very, very grateful to Secretary-General Stoltenberg and my NATO colleagues for the productive discussions that we've been able to have thus far today to lay the groundwork for the alliance summit in Warsaw this July.

Before I say more, though, I want to express my condolences to Egypt and to all other countries impacted by the disappearance earlier this morning of the EgyptAir flight over the Mediterranean. The United States is providing assistance in the search effort and relevant authorities are doing everything they can to try to find out what the facts are of what happened today. I have no more knowledge than others at this point with respect to those facts, but we certainly extend our condolences to each and every country that has lost people, and particularly to Egypt, which has made so many efforts in recent months to break out of and away from the last events. And so no matter what, I think everybody -- our thoughts are with them and with all the passengers.

No matter what crisis demands our attention at this moment -- and obviously there are many -- we are never taking our eye off of the larger picture, which is what NATO and this meeting is really all about. Nearly 70 years ago, NATO was formed in order to ensure the collective defense of like-minded countries. And after today's meetings, I can confirm to you extraordinary unity. The alliance morale and sense of purpose is very strong, perhaps as strong as it's ever been. And the tragic bombings of two months ago in this great capital city simply reinforced the determination of all the partner countries to maintain vigilance within and beyond the borders of each of our nations and to prepare for the possibility of danger in any form, including terrorism, cyber attacks, and hybrid warfare.

Now, we all know that readiness does not just magically appear because you say we've got to be ready. It comes from investing in the right capabilities and in getting ahead of the challenges so that adversaries understand, fully and clearly, that they will never defeat or divide us. And that is why we are enhancing our forward presence in the east of Europe. It is why we are projecting stability in the south. And it is why we are deepening our cooperation with the European Union and the counter-Daesh coalition.

I just reported in my comments to our colleagues a few minutes ago that not since last May -- that is a year now -- has Daesh moved into territory, taken over a community, and held that community for a period of time. And we believe that we are making progress with -- over 90 percent of the citizens of Tikrit have returned to Tikrit, which was liberated. And now people are working similarly in Ramadi and in other areas.

To NATO's south, every alliance member is supportive of the efforts of the International Syria Support Group to solidify a nationwide cessation of hostilities, to secure humanitarian access, and to facilitate a Syrian-led transition of the type that was envisioned by the 2012 Geneva communique. If implemented, this plan will further isolate Daesh and al-Nusrah and create the basis for the end of a war and a safe return of refugees. But even if it isn't fully implemented in the near term, the efforts to eliminate Daesh are growing by the day, with more commitments by more nations that are determined to end this scourge.

Now meanwhile, NATO's defense capacity-building program is augmenting efforts by the counter-Daesh coalition to assist the Security Forces of Iraq. The more efficient and effective that the forces of Iraq become, the better able they're going to be to liberate territory from the terrorists and the more stable Iraq is going to be in the years to come.

At sea, I informed allies that the United States is finalizing plans to send a naval vessel to the Aegean to join NATO's maritime effort in that region in order to deter illegal migration and human trafficking. Tonight we will review our ongoing work to strengthen NATO's eastern flank and to deter aggression. And a key aspect of our response to the actions -- Russia's actions in Ukraine is to meet the Wales commitments on defense investments and to continue to strengthen our deterrence capabilities through a more robust forward presence and with associated steps that I think have been described to you. That is why we are contributing $3.4 billion to the European Reassurance Initiative. NATO has been and has to be ready to and engaged in a willingness to be open to a political dialogue with Russia, but we refrain from a business as usual until Minsk commitments are fully implemented. That is critical. And make no mistake, we will not recognize the annexation and the occupation of Crimea.

Now, the United States also remains fully committed to NATO's open door policy. And we are pleased that Montenegro is moving forward on its path to joining the alliance. Montenegro's accession underscores once again our determination to be able to make membership decisions that are free from outside influences and that underscore our resolve to stand together against any kind of threat that we face in a world that I have just defined of many different kinds of threats, some of them very new.

Tomorrow we will discuss Afghanistan. And we're going to review the progress of the Resolute Support mission and the need to continue our financial assistance for Afghan Security Forces and the imperative of planning for a new, flexible, regional presence beyond 2016. I will reiterate that America's commitment to maintain 9,800 troops in Afghanistan through most of this year and 5,500 thereafter remains, with 3,400 assigned to NATO responsibilities.

Now obviously, you can tell from the comments I've made and others -- that others have made that NATO has a full agenda, but we are united both diplomatically and in the security measures that we're taking. We are strengthening ourselves to deal with both our present and our future. And we're working more cooperatively with partner institutions and with groups than NATO ever has before. We are looking forward, I think, with full confidence and anticipation for what it will accomplish to the Warsaw Summit in just a few weeks. And that is the purpose of our meeting here today, is to prepare and make sure that that summit has the ingredients of success that it needs to have at this critical moment.

So with that, I would be delighted to answer a couple questions.

MR TONER: Great. Our first question goes to Lesley Wroughton from Reuters.

QUESTION: Hi, Mr. Secretary. You said you have no knowledge what might have caused the crash of Egypt Air. But if it was terrorism, what do you think the response should be? Did the U.S. intelligence agencies detect anything -- a sign of a bomb or a terrorist connection -- with regard to this plane?

You said there was unity among the alliance today. What do you think the -- should NATO play a larger role in the fight against ISIS? What can it do?

And then just quickly on Libya, we've been hearing for months that NATO has a mandate to support the new government in Tripoli. Given those -- these discussions today and those in Vienna, do you think NATO should have a bigger role in that?

SECRETARY KERRY: So with respect to the airplane, Lesley, I think I said -- and I'm not going to speculate at this point in time -- I just don't have the information on which to base this, and I don't think the experts have the information yet on which to base this. And nothing does more harm to people or countries than to start speculating ahead of time, so I'm -- I don't want to do that.

With respect to NATO and Syria and NATO and Libya, the answer is yes, in both places NATO has an ability to be able to help. It's what I call a complementary role. It's not the essential role or the front role, but it's a complementary role, where NATO has particular expertise and capacity for training. NATO has a particular ability to be able to do some work with respect to resource allocation, transfer, deployment in order to help with the process of stabilization in the aftermath of a community being liberated.

In addition, NATO has the capacity to be able to provide intelligence, whether it's through overflight or insight or other ways. There are assets that NATO has developed and capacities NATO has developed to be able to plus-up the effort in order to locate terrorists, track terrorists, define who is a terrorist in operations on the ground, and help inform the battle commanders.

And with respect to Libya, there's also an issue -- and with respect to, obviously, the outgrowth of Syria, NATO can play a maritime role in terms of assisting Operation Sophia and others in order to prevent illegal migration, illegal human trafficking from taking place.

So there are -- there's a varied menu of things that NATO has the ability to do, and I think there was, to the best of my knowledge, quite, I think, a unanimous sense in the discussions we had today that that can help us, with proper definition, proper limits. Obviously there are certain things NATO should not be doing, and nobody here was suggesting that there is a NATO forward combat role. But there is a complementary support kind of role that NATO can play in order to augment the resources and the focus, the visibility, and the interpretation of what is happening in the region, as well as particularly to empower those people who are on the ground to be able to engage in the fight that they have chosen to be engaged in.

And I think we are all unanimous in our commitment to help those who are committed to fight radical, extreme violence in the world, whether it comes from Daesh or Boko Haram or al-Qaida. This is a fight that all of us are committed to win, and NATO needs to be part of that, because it is helping to defend this region that is suffering the consequences not just in the events that happened here in Brussels with bombs going off or the attacks that have taken place in Paris or attacks in Ankara or attacks in many other places, but also the flow of foreign fighters and the incredible impact on countries, and the humanitarian catastrophe that we see unfolding with massive numbers of migrants, refugees who are seeking a new life in one place or another.

That's a challenge that everybody has to face, and it would be a remarkable statement for the NATO alliance, with all of the affected countries that are engaged in this battle, to have this asset and this capacity just sitting on the sidelines in a fight that so many people need to be engaged in -- but again, in appropriate ways, with appropriate limits, with an appropriate set of standards and interpretations.

MR TONER: Good. Our second question goes to Marija Jovicevic from Pobjeda newspaper.

QUESTION: Thank you. Today is important day for Montenegro. It shows that that open door policy works. What does this means for Montenegro alliance and other aspirants?

SECRETARY KERRY: I can't hear you. I'm sorry.

QUESTION: Okay. Again, maybe louder. Today is important day for Montenegro. It shows that the open door policy works. What does this mean for Montenegro aliens and other aspirants?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, Montenegro has worked extremely hard to get where it is. And Montenegro has had to meet certain standards. Montenegro has had to work over a number of years now in order to ready itself for the responsibilities that it wants to assume. And it also has to meet certain standards with respect to democracy, the participation of its people, and the support of its people.

So these decisions are not made lightly, but what it means is that NATO is going to look at a particular country with care, with precision. It's going to have to measure the meeting of tests that have been put in place over a period of time, and that NATO will not be influenced by some kind of outside event or series of lobbying efforts or other things, but on the measure of the criteria for membership NATO will make its decision appropriately. And it means that the open door policy actually has meaning; that it is open; and that countries that, in fact, work hard to meet the standard have an opportunity to be able to find membership.

MR TONER: Last question goes to Carol Morello from The Washington Post.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary -- oh, thank you. Both France and Egypt have made proposals aimed at restarting Middle East peace talks, suggesting a certain impatience, even exasperation, at the U.S. failure to get Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table. And the French have just announced that they're going to hold a conference on June 3rd and that you will attend.

So the question is, in your opinion, is there any realistic scenario -- either by the French, the Egyptians, or any other out there -- in which peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians could resume before the end of this year? And what will it take?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, certainly, you can't -- let me underscore something. I mean, you used the word ""failure."" I have to sort of -- it's not the failure of the United States or any other country to bring people back to the table. It's the failure of those countries themselves to make a decision to come back to the table. Now, we work together on these things. This is not just a U.S. enterprise; it never has been. We play a very significant role, yes, because we have a very special and close relationship and have through the years with Israel. And everybody in the world understands that. When I was in the United States Senate, I'm proud to say I had a 100 percent voting record for the state of Israel because I thought it was worthy and appropriate. And we supported Israel because Israel was under attack and countries were at war, and that's been a history for a long period of time.

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't also be a powerful force working for peace. President Obama committed enormous energy to this effort for years. Beginning before I became the Secretary of State, he was engaged in working on the issue. Senator George Mitchell was appointed as a special envoy, and there was a long process of effort to try to make something happen. It didn't. I then engaged, and there was a process of trying to make something happen. And then events intervened that broke that apart, despite the fact that we actually made significant progress during that period of time.

Now, the parties have to make the decision to come back to the table. But it is not inappropriate for countries, all of whom actually care about both parties and care about peace, to want to try to come together in an effort to find if there is a pathway to be helpful. In the end, the parties have to negotiate. You can't impose it on people, and we're not seeking to do that. I never sought to do that. What we are seeking to do is help encourage the parties to be able to see a way forward so that they can understand that peace is indeed a possibility.

And I know that the French have the concept of a conference, which we welcome. We are talking with them about exactly how it might work, what shape it might take, what the outcomes might be. And the foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and I met today, and I certainly intend to be helpful and cooperative with the French in a cooperative way that makes sense for the parties in order to encourage them to come to the table. Likewise, the Egyptians are very important to this process, and I certainly welcome President al-Sisi's comments about being willing to be helpful and work the process.

So all of this, it seems to me, is positive -- people working effectively to try to encourage the parties to come to the table and negotiate. But in the end, as I said, the parties themselves have to make the decision to actually negotiate, and in that, clearly, there will have to be some compromise. Without compromise, it's not possible. I'm not saying compromise your security or compromise on a fundamental kind of objective, but you've got to compromise in what the other people also need in order to be able to bring it together. And in the end, you reach an agreement if your needs are met. That is the challenge.

And so I will work with the French. I'll work with Egyptians. I will work with the Arab community. I'll work with the global community in good faith in an effort to see if we can find a way to help the parties see their way to come back and ultimately see their way to a final status agreement that meets the needs of the parties, the needs of the region, and provides for peace and stability. It's an enormously high priority. President Obama remains deeply committed to it, and so do I.

QUESTION: Can you confirm you're going on the 3rd?

SECRETARY KERRY: I can confirm -- I don't know if the 3rd is the date that he has set precisely, but I told him that I will be there.

MR TONER: Thank you.",,,06/24/16 11:27 AM
53306,1096870,Joint Press Availability With Mongolian Foreign Minister Lundeg,06/05/16,10,"FOREIGN MINISTER PUREVSUREN: (Via interpreter) Good morning. On the invitation by the Mongolian Government, John Kerry, the Secretary, has been making state visit to Mongolia. Mongolia and the U.S. has -- have been expanding its cooperation in a variety of sectors. From the beginning of the democratic movement in Mongolia, the U.S. was our partner, one of the most important, third neighbor of Mongolia. Third neighbor relationship is not only at the level of political ties, but also in terms of the friendship between the people, we have been enjoying such a friendship.

Today -- and in other sectors, we have exchanged our views -- in particular, to develop people-to-people connections and cultural connections. We also discussed about Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact and implementation of the second compact. Both parties are -- both countries are working diligently to implement this initiative.

We also talked about regional and international issues. State -- Secretary of State John Kerry will meet volunteers from Peace Corps after this press conference. He will also meet with representatives of Mongolian Young Leaders and he will pay a visit to President Elbegdorj, and after that, he will have the opportunity to experience Mongolian Naadam. Thank you.

Thank you. And I would like to invite John Kerry to make a brief statement.

SECRETARY KERRY: Thank you. (Inaudible.) Good to be here with all of you. I've really been looking forward to visiting Mongolia for some period of time, and the minister and I had a chance to talk when we visited last time. I promised him I would get here, and it seemed like a good opportunity as I am going to two days of discussions in China. It's really good to be meeting with my friend, the foreign minister, also to participate in a working lunch with President Elbegdorj, and frankly, just to soak up a little bit of the culture of the country in the short time that I am here.

There's a perception among some people that the United States and Mongolia are distant from one another, and -- but we don't define our relationship in the context of just miles or geography. It's not true that we are distant from each other. Geographically, we also share the same neighbors across the narrow reaches of the Northern Pacific and, when it comes to our hopes, our aspirations for our people, the type of governments that we have both chosen to implement, we really couldn't be closer.

A little more than a quarter of a century ago, Mongolia chose democracy. And through the time since then, the United States has sought to help. We have supported projects, as the minister just mentioned -- the Millennium Challenge Corporation -- projects to spur economic growth, reduce poverty, including this $285 million compact through the Millennium Challenge Corporation. It has been doing a great deal now to build roads, to help on health, education, and other issues. We have backed initiatives to improve education and increase access to energy, to fight pollution, to empower women, to halt trafficking in persons, and to advance human rights. And we have worked hard to expand both academic and cultural exchange programs.

So we remain very fully committed to strengthening the bilateral economic relationship. And just this week, our Commerce Department will be leading a delegation of U.S. agricultural firms to explore opportunities for new investment in Mongolia in this connection. Now, I understand the Mongolian Government soon intends to implement our bilateral Transparency Agreement. And I have to tell you that this agreement, the implementation of this agreement, is really key -- a very important step to be able to attract foreign direct investment. And foreign investment is critical to the growth and development and kicking the Mongolian economy back into gear.

Another reason that we value our friendship with Mongolia is that it is playing a very important role as a responsible global citizen. Obviously, it's a young democracy, but it nevertheless is sharing the lessons of its own evolution with other countries, particularly with Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar. And Myanmar, as we all know, has undergone an historic transformation. Mongolia is playing a very constructive role at the UN Human Rights Council, in the Community of Democracies, and as a member of the Freedom Online Coalition. So its -- in addition to that, Mongolia has committed peacekeeping troops who are widely respected and have helped to make a difference in Sudan, South Sudan, and elsewhere. They've also been serving alongside American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. So just what I just articulated describes a very fulsome global relationship on the part of a small country, but a country that recognizes the importance of its global citizenship responsibilities. Just this past week, the United States was very pleased to co-sponsor the Khaan Quest Exercises with Mongolia -- which was a massive operation that brings together more than 40 nations and 2,000 participants to improve peacekeeping practices and tactics.

And perhaps the clearest sign of closeness between our countries is our joint commitment to stronger people-to-people ties. To facilitate travel, my government is working to make it easier for Mongolian businesspeople, students, and tourists to obtain visas. And the United States is also sustaining its commitment to the highly successful Peace Corps program, which, I'm happy to tell you all has just marked 25 years of remarkable service here.

With us today, in fact, are a group of current and former Peace Corps volunteers who represent more than 1,150 men and women who have served in each of Mongolia's 21 provinces. And I want to thank all of you for what you have done to assist in language training, in health and community development and, most of all, in just building the bonds of friendship between our countries, which is vital. You've been terrific representatives of America and we are very grateful to the relationship between Mongolia and the Peace Corps.

The bottom line is very simple: Mongolia has made remarkable progress for a young democracy even as it strives to strengthen its institutions and to keep up with the hopes of its people. A little later I'm going to have a chance to meet, as the minister said, with a group of young leaders and I very much look forward to hearing from them about how to accelerate their desire to grow their democracy, grow their economy , growth their own participation in the affairs of their nation.

So I thank my friend, Foreign Minister Purevsuren, for his welcome here, for his dogged representation of his country. I'm grateful for the warm welcome and would be very happy to answer a couple questions.

MODERATOR: (Via interpreter) -- a question from Mongolian press, and after that, from the U.S. press. Now we'll take the question.

QUESTION: (Via interpreter) Good afternoon. From the Mongolian National Broadcast, my name is Tuson Jargo (ph). When we talk about America, Mongolians wish for one thing: that is to travel to U.S. without visa. American citizens have been traveling to Mongolia without a visa since 2000 -- in 1991, and when will Mongolia gain a visa-free status?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, we're working at it and we hope it'll be sooner rather than later. We are not trying to resist. We want Mongolian students to come to America. We want travelers, we want tourists, we want businesspeople. We really want to have a robust exchange of our citizens. And we're proud of the fact that so many people respect the relationship that we already have developed, but we have a very fixed legislatively mandated set of requirements that have to be met in terms of our visa-free program. And we've agreed -- we talked about it just this morning. We've agreed to redouble our efforts and to work harder to make sure that the requirements that are set out by the United States Congress, which I have to meet, are in fact being met. The sooner we can do that, the better as far as we're concerned. But we have some work to do.

MODERATOR: (Via interpreter) Thank you. Now we'll take one question from representative from the U.S. press.

QUESTION: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary and foreign minister. Secretary Kerry, you just mentioned that you are heading to China for the last round of Strategic & Economic Dialogue with China. The talk is meant to defuse tensions in about the regional hot issues, but tensions on the South China Sea has been increasing and we have heard Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has some very serious concern. What more can the United States do to disencourage China from further militarization of the disputed islands in the South China Sea? Also, does talks about China planning to announce an ADIZ, which is Air Defense Identification Zone. What is your take on that? Is that consider as a red line?

SECRETARY KERRY: So let me take the second part of your question first, but I'll answer both parts of the question, obviously. We would consider an ADIZ, an ADIZ zone, over portions of the South China Sea as a provocative and destabilizing act, which would automatically raise tensions and call into serious question China's commitment to diplomatically manage the territorial disputes of the South China Sea. So we urge China not to move unilaterally in ways that are provocative.

We have consistently said to China -- this is the second part of your question -- the first part of your question. We have consistently said to China we don't take sides -- in anybody who is a claim -- claimant, we don't take sides on the claims. What we do say is that neither -- nobody, no party -- should try to resolve those claims by unilaterally moving to alter the facts in the South China Sea and then try to present them as fait accompli, they cannot be negotiated.

We have heard President Xi come to Washington and say that they -- China -- will not engage in militarization of the -- of the sea, of the reefs, islands. And we believe that it is critical that no country move unilaterally to militarize the region. What we are urging is a diplomatic, political resolution. We are urging countries to meet bilaterally. We're urging them to engage in a discussion, and our hope is that that's the means by which this is going to be resolved. The United States will always back up diplomatic initiative. We support a quiet process of diplomacy, which is far preferable to unilateral actions that raise the tensions of the Sea.

We are not making any acts within the Sea thus far who have secured land or to have staked a claim of one kind or another on behalf of one country or another. We are simply urging the diplomatic process, dialogue, negotiation, and try to resolve this peacefully and respectfully through rule of law and through the institutions that have been set up in order to implement rule of law resolution.

MODERATOR: Thank you for coming. Now the press conference is closed.",,,06/24/16 02:57 PM
53306,1097410,"Press Availability in Beijing, China",06/07/16,10,"MR KIRBY: The Secretary does not have an opening statement, and so we will go right to questions. We only have time for two tonight. The first one will be from Yeganeh Torbati from Reuters. Where are you? There she is. Somebody get her a microphone, please?

SECRETARY KERRY: Good evening, everybody. Let me just say to you all that I apologize for, obviously, it being very late. Secretary Lew and I were supposed to be here together, but we did have an extended meeting with President Xi, a very productive meeting, and then subsequently we had another event, the Smart Cities Low-Carbon event with State Councilor Yang Jiechi. So we're just literally running behind, and I apologize for that. I'm going to let the statement that I made earlier with Secretary Lew and with the vice premier and state councilor -- that's effectively the summary of what took place in the statement, so I thought we could just go straight into a question.

MR KIRBY: Go ahead, Yeganeh.

QUESTION: Secretary Kerry, thank you so much for this. We heard you had some very tough talks over human rights issues over the past couple days. What do you see as the dangers of the foreign NGO law, and what do you think the consequences will be as a result?

And then secondly, I know you're not -- your role is not to comment on politics, but I wanted to get your reflections on the news of today, which is that your predecessor, Hillary Clinton, has now become the first woman in American history to clinch the nomination of a major presidential party. Thank you very much. Major party. Thank you.

SECRETARY KERRY: I'm sorry, the -- what time is it here? (Laughter.)

QUESTION: It's about 8:30, sir.

SECRETARY KERRY: Oh, okay. So the primary hasn't happened yet, has it?

QUESTION: Right. But she -- AP has called the race.

SECRETARY KERRY: Oh. Well, I haven't heard that, so -- (laughter).

With respect to the NGO law, we had a very in-depth, thorough discussion of not just the NGO law but of several laws that have been put in place. But I was, frankly, given reason to feel that we have registered very significantly the feelings of NGOs, of businesses, of various entities in various parts of the world, all of whom have expressed some concern about these laws. As you know, the government held a period of consultation or information gathering about it in response. We were among those who responded. So there's already been some calculation or adjustment accordingly.

And what we heard today and I what I heard directly from President Xi, actually, was that China intends to remain open, to stay open, to open up even more than it is today, and that it does not see that these laws are going to be applied in any way whatsoever that affects the ability to open up and to do business and for people to feel confident about what they're doing here, and was very clear that if indeed there were some judgment to the contrary, that they would have to think that through very carefully because of their interest in attracting business, doing business, having foreign direct investment, and continuing to grow and take part in the global community.

So I think that we have to sort of show some patience, if you will, to see how, in fact, it is interpreted. We could not have registered our concerns more directly or forcefully, and I think we have to see what happens in the days ahead. But I thought it was not insignificant that the president of the country spoke very directly to what he wants to see happen in its application, and now the question is: Is that, in fact, what happens? So we have to wait and see.

MR KIRBY: Our final question tonight comes from Chen Weiwei from CCTV.

QUESTION: Thank you. My question is about the speech of Chinese President Xi made at the opening ceremony. He called for deepened communication and control difference constructively, and he said that the Pacific Ocean should not become an arena for rivalry but a platform for inclusive cooperation. So Mr. Secretary, how do you respond to this? Would you --

SECRETARY KERRY: A platform for what?

QUESTION: A platform for inclusive cooperation.

SECRETARY KERRY: Inclusive cooperation. Well, we would agree fundamentally with that statement. We don't want -- I think President Obama has said very similar things, that the Pacific is large enough for everybody and that if the rules and norms of maritime behavior are respected, then there shouldn't be any challenge whatsoever.

I think that our position is very clear with respect to maritime law. We want the traditional historic freedom of navigation and overflight to be respected. China has said it will be respected. And so hopefully, as we go forward, President Obama's policy that he has expressed many times will, in fact, dovetail with the stated policy of China, which is that this should be resolved -- whatever differences there are should be resolved by negotiation, should be resolved by consultation, and should be resolved, as President Obama has said, by adherence to rule of law.

And China has said to us in the last couple of days repeatedly that they believe that it needs to be resolved under the terms of the Law of the Sea and the terms of the code of conduct, which needs to be completed. So if those things take place, hopefully restraint and common sense will rule the day and we can see these issues resolved. I think it's important, and we've said this many times, that no claimant -- none, not any country -- engage in unilateral actions that could be deemed by somebody else to be provocative and therefore problematic.

So I took the president's speech as a constructive speech. I thought overall the president set a good tone for the Security & Economic Dialogue[1], and we were very pleased that the president took the time to come and to open the last two days of discussions. I think that he articulated a program that really, in the end, became the focus of most of our discussions over the course of the next couple of days, which as you've heard from everybody I think, were very productive. We didn't agree on everything, as I said in the statement earlier this afternoon, and as each of the Chinese leaders said, we do have some differences. But what we did over the last two days was professionally, respectfully, I think thoughtfully, articulate those differences and agreed on ways in which we can try to find progress.

There is no question, as we -- I think each of us said in our comments this afternoon, that there is far more agreement than disagreement and far more places on which we are now cooperating, whether it's in science or education or people-to-people, sports exchanges, business, different educational opportunities -- there's just a massive amount. Law enforcement, Iran, the UN, the resolution on North Korea -- you can run a list of places where the United States and China have found common ground and been able to create progress. The Paris agreement on climate change is a monumental example of that, and our cooperation on Ebola, our cooperation on health -- there are just many frontiers of cooperation.

And so yes, there are some differences, but even those we are trying to find a thoughtful and constructive way to manage so that the two largest economies in the world and two countries representing very significant parts of the world and interests and value systems and cultural differences and history could come together and help to shape a world that, frankly, needs some shaping. And we are looking at the big picture because we think that the big picture is what many people want two important nations like ours to focus on, not to be dragged down into squabbles that lend more sense of disarray or chaos or failed leadership to a world that already has enough challenges.

So I found this to be an extremely constructive two days. I think it was the most productive of the four Security & Economic Dialogues[2] that I've taken part in, and I think it did a good job to help set the stage for a very productive G20 and a very productive meeting between our two presidents when they come together in a few months.

Thank you all. Appreciate it.

MR KIRBY: Thanks very much, everybody. Thank you.

SECRETARY KERRY: Thank you.",,,06/27/16 10:55 AM
53306,1097442,Roundtable with Press at the General Assembly Of the Organization of American States,06/14/16,10,"SECRETARY KERRY: Guys, we're on a real deadline. I apologize. We're just running late.

QUESTION: Can you tell us how it went? It looks like it was not exactly warm at the beginning.

SECRETARY KERRY: It was a good meeting. No, it wasn't a question of not being warm in the beginning, but there was nothing that -- it wasn't un-warm. It just was not a meeting with -- I haven't sat with her -- it's the first meeting -- so I wouldn't say it wasn't warm. We had a very congenial, very respectful, very constructive conversation. Extremely constructive. In fact, we agreed to have a dialogue immediately that works with both she and me and Tom Shannon continuing his conversations that he had. But we -- I raised the four points that we've raised all along and raised earlier in my comments publicly about wanting a dialogue and supporting the process and the need to -- for them to engage people and take steps to prove that they're ready to implement the constitutional process and engage with the recall and do the things necessary to give confidence to people.

We made it about -- my conversation was about Venezuela writ large, not about the details of a particular argument right now. We talked a moment -- she was explaining the recall referendum, and I said, ""Look, we're not -- it doesn't make sense for us to get stuck in those points here. We're not going to resolve that kind of thing this afternoon. What we can do is reach an agreement that we want to resolve -- we want to change this dynamic and we want to try to engage with each other more constructively and get something done."" And she said, ""Absolutely agree, and we want to do that.""

QUESTION: So when you said you've agreed to have a dialogue including you, her and Tom Shannon --

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, Shannon will first go down there and sit and meet with them -- again, by the way, he has been -- but with a specific view, with a specifically larger agenda that will then, I hope, bring Delcy and myself together and in a way that gets us beyond the old rhetoric. And I said that point blank. I said, ""Look, we can't be stuck in this old rhetorical battle here. We've got to get to something that meets the needs of the people of Venezuela and respects the Venezuelan constitution and process."" That's what we talked about.

QUESTION: Given the meeting of June 23rd, is your country allowed to push to have Venezuela suspended from the organization?

SECRETARY KERRY: No, we're not -- we don't want to do that. I'm not. The United States is not taking that position. We're not pushing for a suspension. We don't think that would be constructive.

QUESTION: And then how does one get between what you --

SECRETARY KERRY: Certainly, I mean, at this point in time, certainly, we're -- we can get a constructive process. I think it's more constructive to have the dialogue than to isolate at this point.

QUESTION: So how do you move from what you're talking about as the dialogue to something that would be the opposition and the government --

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, that's what we talked about. There are two tracks, and I specifically said we will continue to support and leverage the Zapatero et al. track and try to make that work, but we also need work on our bilateral track to the degree that that diminishes from your willingness to do the other. And it also, I hope, will give us the ability to help in terms of the Zapatero track too. I think they're not mutually exclusive, frankly.

QUESTION: Did she repeat her call to apologize for the 1965 invasion of the Dominican Republic?

SECRETARY KERRY: No, we didn't discuss it. No.

QUESTION: And about the --

SECRETARY KERRY: I'm going to speak with her tomorrow about it briefly, but we didn't discuss it.

QUESTION: And about the embargo, she was talking during the meeting about --

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, she talked about it in the meeting, but I don't know what embargo we're actually talking about here. We don't have an economic embargo. And there are seven people who have been sanctioned for their individual activities, but the government has not been sanctioned. There's no sanction against the Government of Venezuela. So I don't -- there is no embargo in place.

QUESTION: Your backing for calls for recall -- so you're supporting calls for the recall of President --

SECRETARY KERRY: We're supporting the constitutional process.

QUESTION: Yeah, so can -- just can you explain to us, what are you --

SECRETARY KERRY: We're not taking sides. We're just supporting the constitutional process. The opposition has a right under their constitution. And as she pointed out, there are two constitutions -- theirs and Bolivia's -- that have that right. And we talked about it; we talked about the recall. But we're supporting it in the context of a constitutional prerogative available to the opposition which they have chosen to exercise and have been frustrated in the exercise of, and we're just trying to say, look, you've got to try to respond in ways that indicate an openness to your own enforcement of your own law.

QUESTION: Do you believe Maduro's open to having this dialogue? Do you get the feeling they are ready to negotiate?

SECRETARY KERRY: I assume that the foreign minister is here at an official conference speaking for the country and for the president, and she indicated that he wants to proceed in this direction, and so we will explore that. That's why Tom Shannon will be first to go. I'm not committing myself yet until we have -- I mean, I'm not going yet, but I've committed to try to see if we can make this work, and let's see if we can improve the relationship.

MR TONER: A couple more questions, guys.

QUESTION: Yeah. But there's a new agenda for bilateral meetings between the State Department and the --

SECRETARY KERRY: We hope that that can come out of Tom Shannon's visit.

QUESTION: Do you have a specific date for --

SECRETARY KERRY: Soon, very quickly. There is a lot happening and we don't want this to get out of -- we don't want this to -- this should not sit around. This should not wait. So we'll -- I will be urging Tom to be immediately in touch and to follow up as soon as possible.

QUESTION: Food and medicine shortages, all kinds of (inaudible) --

SECRETARY KERRY: I raised that.

QUESTION: You raised it? Have you offered any kind of assistance?

SECRETARY KERRY: Not yet. I mean, we've offered -- yes, we actually have.

STAFF: And we're waiting for them to request it.

SECRETARY KERRY: But we don't have any mechanism yet or any acknowledgment that that's something that they (inaudible).

QUESTION: Oh, I see.

SECRETARY KERRY: So that's why we'll have this dialogue. I raised the issue of food and medicine and the shortages. I mentioned the IMF judgments about what's happened in their economy and the oil crisis and so forth. And they agreed; I mean, she understood. They're -- they've had some pressures. So first thing, folks, is to get this moving as fast as possible. That's what we'll do today.

Okay?

QUESTION: Okay. Thank you, sir.

53306,1097503,Remarks With Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg,06/15/16,10,"PRIME MINISTER SOLBERG: Good afternoon. I am very pleased to welcome Secretary of State John Kerry to Oslo. We last met in Washington, D.C. in May during the U.S.-Nordic Leaders' Summit. Secretary Kerry's visit here today serves to further underscore the close bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Norway. We are close allies in NATO, we have a close bilateral defense cooperation, and we cooperate on a wide range of global issues where we share the same goals.

Norway and the U.S. are allies and partners in the fight against violent extremism and terrorism. And let me use this opportunity to express my deep condolences after the horrific attack in Florida last Sunday. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims and on the American people.

I am pleased that Secretary Kerry will visit Svalbard during his stay in Norway. (Inaudible) It will be an excellent opportunity to discuss the Arctic and to get the firsthand impression of the effects of global warming. We have just concluded a productive discussion on a broad range of foreign security policy issues. The security challenges we face and the way ahead were at the top of the agenda. So we discussed the developments in Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East, North Africa, and of course, at length also the situation in Syria.

We also had a useful exchange of views on the upcoming NATO Summit in Warsaw. We, from Norway's side, believe that maritime security should be an important priority for NATO. Transatlantic unity will remain a key to successfully address these challenges. Europe must take a larger share of the burden. Norway takes its responsibilities seriously. Our defense budgets have and will continue to increase substantially.

We will continue our substantial contribution to the national efforts to fight ISIL, and we believe that there is a wide range of tools that are necessary in this fight -- both economically and humanitarian, and political and military. The training of the Iraqi Security Forces and local Syrian groups by anti-ISIL coalition is an important part of this effort. We take part in the coalition's efforts to stabilize areas liberated from ISIL and will contribute to stabilization and determining efforts in both Syria and Iraq in 2016.

So I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Secretary Kerry for his tireless work and dedication on international security, on climate change issues, and on ocean stewardship. I am impressed by your tempo and your traveling and your activities in working to, in fact, make the world -- this world -- a little bit better place to live in for all the people. And I look forward to our continued close cooperation as we move forward. Thank you.

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, Madam Prime Minister, thank you very much. Thank you, first of all, for a wonderful welcome. Thank you for a great lunch. Thank you for your expression of condolences with respect to Orlando. We are very much appreciative and we know that Norway knows only too well the price of this kind of event, so we're very grateful to you for your expression of solidarity for the citizens of the United States. And I know my fellow Americans and President Obama appreciate that expression.

We were delighted to welcome you recently to Washington with the other Nordic leaders. It was an excellent meeting and, frankly, gave us a great opportunity to talk about many of the issues that we were able to revisit here today. I'm also, on a personal level, happy to be back in Oslo where I spent some time as a young kid when my dad was in the Foreign Service, so it's nice for me to have a chance to revisit.

My staff recently reminded me that today, Wednesday, is actually named for the Norse god Odin, just as Thursday is named for Thor. So I want you to know that Odin traveled with a flying eight-legged horse, a couple of wolves and ravens, and a spear that simply couldn't miss. I, on the other hand, am here with Ambassador Sam Heins alone, but I'll tell you I wouldn't trade with Odin for anything. So -- and by the way, Sam Heins, no relation, I want you to know. (Laughter.)

I thank Ambassador Heins for his efforts. I really thank the prime minister and my dear friend Borge, who is sitting over here. Borge Brende, the foreign minister of Norway, is a great counterpart, a great colleague, and a good friend after the years we've been working together. And I thank Norway for all that Norway and Norwegians have done to help cement an extraordinary partnership with the United States and to help contribute to the peace and the security of the world. We are all indebted.

The truth is we are very, very grateful of Norway as a NATO ally, and I thanked the prime minister at lunch for the important work that NATO has done with respect to the Northern Flank, shoring up our efforts, reassuring partners that NATO is strong, and that we will confront challenges in the Euro-Atlantic region and across the globe together.

I want to thank Norway also for more than that. Norway provides training to the Afghan police forces every single day. Norway has put more than $1 billion pledged in aid to Syria and to its neighbors over the next four years, and our Norwegian friends are always the first in line when urgent action is required to help people in need. In addition, through the Norwegian Defense International Center, Norway provides its international partners with training for complex, multilateral police operations, including those conducted by the United Nations. And so the United States really welcomes Norway's invitation to extend that training to U.S. military officers. And we look forward to working with the center to develop exactly such a program.

President Obama and I have also valued Norway's partnership in helping to rid a war-torn country of Colombia of land mines. And Borge and I have the privilege of chairing the committee that will work to do exactly that. Last month in Washington we agreed to broaden our nations' efforts by joining with other Nordic leaders in order to address this enormous humanitarian challenge on a global basis. There are young kids who wander into fields or play somewhere in various countries in the world, who die, who are blown up because of unexploded ordnance or mines that are left in place because of conflict. This work is critical, and our partnership with respect to it could not come at a more important time.

As evidence of our shared commitment, the United States and Norway are today announcing an initiative that will take us closer to the broad regional partnership that was envisioned at the Leaders' Summit. And I am pleased to announce today the United States intends to provide an additional 10.8 million this year to clear mines from territory in Iraq that has been liberated by terrorist occupation[1]. And as the prime minister mentioned, Norway in turn is providing an additional 9.8 million for de-mining projects with a particular focus on Iraq and Sfor yria.

I would just mention to people, to underscore the importance of this, just yesterday I was reading some reports coming from Ramadi, which was liberated, where, while thousands of people have been able to return, a hundred people lost their lives when they opened their closet door or opened drawers or opened a refrigerator. And our effort is an effort to try to eliminate that potential and eliminate that fear.

Cooperation between the United States and Norway, obviously, we feel, serves our best interests. But we are also convinced that it helps provide a service to people in many other parts of the world who are in great need. For example, we are both steadfast in our commitment to do something about climate change.

Just yesterday, Norway's parliament agreed to the ratification of the Paris Agreement. And we are deeply grateful for Norway's leadership on this. As President Obama has said, the United States will join soon, this year, and together we're going to work to bring this agreement into force as quickly as possible. And neither of our countries are going to wait around for that to happen. We're pursuing ambitious climate action right now. And later today, I will join Minister Helgesen to sign a joint statement that outlines the deeper collaboration between the United States and Norway on climate change, and specifically on deforestation.

Tomorrow I will have the privilege of joining Foreign Minister Brende when we will go to Svalbard, where we will highlight our partnership through the Arctic Council, which we work very closely on. We're going to see firsthand the impacts of climate change on our Arctic, and we're going to learn more about the remarkable work that our scientists are doing to help the world understand how these changes in polar regions are going to affect every single one of us.

So this September I also look forward to welcoming Foreign Minister Brende, who was one of the first to step up to be willing to lead a Norwegian delegation and to become what we call an ocean champion, as he will come to the third ocean conference we will have in Washington on September 15th and 16th. The foreign minister and I have long shared a deep interest in protecting the oceans. Why? Among other things, the oceans provide 50 percent of the oxygen that we breathe, they are critical to the supply of our food -- literally a third of our fisheries are overfished, and fully two-thirds of them are at maximum. So the challenge as the population grows will be to maintain the oceans as sustainable. And with climate, with increased acidification, with increased amounts of pollution going into the oceans, again, life itself on the planet is threatened.

So Foreign Minister Brende will come and he is determined to ensure that the conference results in specific action. And we will also deal with illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing, in which some people go out and fish using practices that have been banned -- literally strip-mine the ocean, discard a third to two-thirds of the catch, and leave no accountability for what is left behind. So I'm proud to say that at the first conference and with a large pledge by Norway, $4 billion was put forward towards ocean conservation and committed to safeguard almost 6 million square kilometers of our oceans as marine sanctuaries. We hope to increase that this September, and we're hoping the conference will lead to even more people joining in in dealing with this problem of multi-billion-dollar illegal fishing.

So on behalf of President Obama, let me again thank the prime minister and all of our Norwegian hosts, not just for welcoming me here for a visit, but more importantly, for what they do for everybody else in the world. We're very, very grateful. Thank you.

MODERATOR: Thank you. Thank you very much. And now we have time for two short questions. First, (inaudible), Norwegian TV.

QUESTION: Hi. Since you didn't have time to answer one of my questions earlier today, I'm going to ask you two quick questions right now, if that's okay.

SECRETARY KERRY: Okay, all right. I told you I'd be here.

QUESTION: First of all -- (laughter) -- are you happy with Norway's current defense budget, considering NATO's 2 percent goal?

And the second, are you concerned about the safety situation in the world if Donald Trump becomes president?

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, let me give -- first -- the first question: We're extremely happy with what Norway is doing. Norway is a huge contributor to the NATO effort in many different ways, and NATO -- and Norway is increasing, and we know that they're doing so at a time when there are difficult budget constraints -- lots of you have faced that. What's important is they're committed, they're moving in the direction, and so the bottom line is yes, President Obama and I and the Administration are extremely, extremely pleased with Norway's contribution to this alliance.

With respect to Mr. Trump and the election, I am not allowed by our laws to get in the middle of the race, and so I can't answer that question directly.

QUESTION: But you're in Norway now, so --

SECRETARY KERRY: Yeah, well, I'm in Norway now, but I think there's a little thing called TV over here. (Laughter.) But I give you great, great high grades for trying.

Let me -- I will say this, though: What candidates say in an election is critical -- any candidates, on either side, or from wherever they come politically and ideologically. And nothing is more important to the world right now than American leadership. So I believe that the people of America need to weigh and will weigh very carefully who is going to keep our country safe, who is going to keep us on a direction of building relationships -- not breaking them -- and who is going to be able to connect to the values and the hopes and the aspirations of people around the world. Americans, I've learned personally, are pretty darn good at making those judgments, and I'm confident in the American people. So they will decide in November, and you will have a lot of opportunity to hear and see the candidates debating, and making up their minds.

So I'll let it rest at that.

MODERATOR: Yes. Matt Lee, AP.

QUESTION: Hi. Mr. Secretary, I'd like to ask you about your meeting with Foreign Minister Zarif this morning. Just this week, both he and the supreme leader again complained about the pace and scope of sanctions relief that they're getting and accused the United States of not following through on its commitments under the JCPOA. So I'd like to ask you, one, are you as a result of the meeting this morning prepared to further clarify or ease some sanctions to respond to those complaints?

And then secondly, in your comments at the Oslo Forum just now, you mentioned that you're -- and based on your conversation with the foreign minister, you thought that there was a possible way forward in Syria that would give the cessation of hostilities and a political transition a prayer. And I'm just wondering if you can elaborate a bit on it.

SECRETARY KERRY: Well, let me -- with respect to the JCPOA, the United States of America has done absolutely everything that we were and are required to do according to the letter of the agreement. We have lifted the sanctions we said we would lift, and we have completely kept faith with both the black-and-white print as well as the spirit of this effort. In fact, I have personally gone beyond the absolute requirements of lifting the sanctions to personally engage with banks and businesses and others who have a natural reluctance after several years of sanctions to move without fully understanding what they are allowed to do and what they aren't allowed.

And so a lot of clarification has been necessary, more so than I think any of us imagined when we made the agreement. I think it is a matter of good faith in order to make sure that Iran gets the benefits that Iran is entitled for having joined in this agreement and taken major steps to denuclearize -- steps of undoing their centrifuges, destroying their calandria core of the plutonium reactor, reducing their research and development, and other major steps Iran has taken. And if banks are reluctant of their own caution or misunderstanding, then I think it is important for us to appropriately clarify things in a way that can allow what is entitled to, in fact, happen and to flow. And if you don't do that then you wind up actually putting your very agreement at risk. You -- there are two sides to an agreement always, and I think it's unfair for us to simply sit there and say, ""Okay, we got our side, now the other side can't get theirs.""

So we are working hard to make sure banks know they are entitled to do business. Banks can open accounts -- European banks can open accounts. They are allowed to do business. They are allowed to fund projects. All of these things are allowed under the agreement. And I think that the supreme leader and Prime Minister Zarif are pressing to make sure that that happens as clear as possible and as rapidly as possible, and we're going to follow through.

Now, where there are things that we can't do we've been very clear that it's not under our control and we're not able to do this, and we've been crystal clear with them about that. I think there are some things where the United States could actually help to clear up misunderstandings. I think there are places where the United States could give confidence where there is doubt. And I feel that it is important for us, if we're going to have future dealings, or we want a reputation for good faith in the negotiations we conduct anywhere, it's important for us to show good faith in executing this agreement. And I intend to see to it that we do that.

Now with respect to the ceasefire, we simply had a very brief conversation because this is not Foreign Minister's Zarif's portfolio, and we don't go into it in great depth. But I had a sense in talking to him, as I asked him about the procedure, that there may be some possibilities. But I don't believe in advertising possibilities before they're real or certainly before people have had a chance to explore them.

I will say this about this cessation of hostilities that's important, I think, for people to understand. The United States of America joined with other countries, particularly the other members of the Permanent Five of the United Nations, as well as other parties that are interested in working on the coalition to deal with Syria, and we signed up to a cessation of hostilities, which is now enshrined in UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and it doesn't call for a selective ceasefire, it calls for a nationwide ceasefire. And it applies to the Assad regime just as it applies to the opposition. As I have said previously, from day one there have been challenges in Aleppo particularly, and Latakia, to having even one day of the regime actually live out that cessation. So we've made it very clear that unless we get a better definition of how this cessation is going to work, how it will be enforced, who it applies to, how it is applied, we are not going to sit there while Assad continues to offensively assault Aleppo and while Russia continues to support in that effort.

We believe there is a way to provide this clarification. We believe we can achieve enforcement on both sides. We believe that is the only way to get to the table in Geneva to begin to negotiate a legitimate transition. So there is a way forward, and that's what I was referring to. But it will require a good effort in the next week, in the next days in order to achieve it. And the United States is not going to sit there and be used as an instrument that permits a so-called ceasefire to be in place while one principal party is trying to take advantage of it to the detriment of the entire process. We're not going to allow that to continue. So Russia and others have to make the decision whether or not they care about the course of events in Syria and whether or not they're serious about implementing the UN Security Council resolution.

MODERATOR: Yes, thank you very much.

QUESTION: And would you say that Norway has become a more important country strategically because of the conflict between the West and Russia?

SECRETARY KERRY: No. I would say that Norway has always been important strategically, and I think its importance has always been extremely high because it's been one of the most reliable and important members of NATO, and consistently been supportive with respect to the northern area and Russia.

PRIME MINISTER SOLBERG: And I thought that was such a good comment, but I'm going to get you out of that door before they ask more because you have (inaudible). (Laughter.)",,,06/27/16 11:32 AM
