775,1073744,Introduction of A Bill to Permit Commercial Filming and Photography on the Grounds of the U.S. Capitol,01/05/16,14,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill to permit  commercial filming and photography on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol,  east of Union Square, the only area where such filming is currently  authorized. This bill would permit commercial photography and filming  outside of the Capitol and congressional office buildings by permit, so  long as both the House and Senate are not in session. In today's world,  where many societies are facing upheavals, our country should be the  first to encourage commercial photography and filming of the Capitol,  which symbolizes U.S. democracy at work. Hollywood and other commercial  filmmakers should not have to go to other or fake capitol buildings for  movies and films about the U.S. Capitol. The current policy permitting  filming near the United States Botanic Garden shows that the Capitol  police can handle filmmaking on Capitol grounds, especially when  Congress is not in session. However, filming from that vantage point  captures the least familiar view of the Capitol. At a time when the  reputation of Congress is particularly low, filming of the Capitol, a  building that represents American democracy, could bolster its image.  Keeping filmmakers from standing in front of the Capitol is neither  business-friendly nor true to the nation's democratic traditions.  Encouraging commercial photography and filming at the Capitol would  help spread the story of our national legislature around the world. The  time is overdue to allow to commercial filming and photography of the  exterior of the historic 19th century Capitol building. 

  There is no good reason why commercial filming and photography should  be confined to Union Square. Specifically, my bill gives the Capitol  Police the discretion, depending on the circumstances in and around the  Capitol, to issue a permit authorizing commercial filming and  photography under the same conditions as those in Union Square. Such  areas might include, for example, Independence Avenue on the House side  and Constitution Avenue on the Senate side. No policy or security  reason exists to justify limiting commercial filming and photography of  the Capitol complex to only one location, Union Square, particularly  considering that permits are necessary. People are regularly seen on  East Capitol Street (east of 2nd Street) taking pictures, where they  get a full view of the Capitol building, demonstrating how arbitrary it  is to limit commercial filming to Union Square. 

  Capitol Police would also have authority to charge a fee to cover any  costs incurred by the Architect of the Capitol as a result of the  issuance of the permit, to be deposited into the Capitol Trust Account.  The Capitol Trust Account was established to accept proceeds from any  fees collected for commercial filming permits for Union Square. Amounts  in the Capitol Trust Account would be available without fiscal year  limitation for such maintenance, improvements, and projects with  respect to the Capitol grounds as the Architect of the Capitol  considers appropriate, subject to the approval of the Committees on  Appropriations of the House and Senate. 

  Views of the U.S. Capitol are among America's most iconic. Limiting  commercial filming and photography of the Capitol, an important vehicle  for telling the nation's story, does not serve the American people.  Indeed, most of the world knows our country and reveres our system of  government largely through commercial photography and films of the  Capitol, which symbolizes our democracy at work. Commercial films and  photographs of the Capitol, the seat of our democracy, are perhaps the  best modern vehicles for telling the nation's story and showcasing its  democratic system of government. My bill would enable appropriate,  permitted commercial filming and photography of the Capitol, and would  create economic benefits for the nation, the city, and private  business. 

  I urge support of this bill.

3457,1074045,Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2015,01/08/16,14,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt suits arising out  of the Fair Housing Act or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 

  I offer my amendment today, Mr. Chairman, out of a real concern about  the consequences the bill will have on social justice issues. One of  these issues that is very dear to me is the disparate access to  financial products for African Americans. That is the reason that I,  before I became a Member of Congress, created a credit union for my  area in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 

  We are still seeing discrimination in housing and auto financing and  insurance products in my home district of Milwaukee. This is not  something, Mr. Chairman, that happened in the good old days. We have  witnessed discrimination in mortgage loans as recently as 2012. 

  As a member of the Financial Services Committee, we have learned  about the CFPB's role in cracking down on auto lenders who discriminate  against minorities. Folks who have the same credit score, if your name  is Rodriguez or Barack Obama Jones, suddenly your auto loan would be at  a higher rate. 

  Class actions are an important tool to fight back. For example, in  Adkins v. Stanley, a class action suit was filed against Morgan Stanley  for practices through a mortgage lender that had a significant impact  against an entire African American community. In Detroit, Michigan,  from where our distinguished ranking member hails, the practices led to  filling these communities with high-risk subprime loans, leading up to  the 2008 housing crisis. I would commend any of you to go to Detroit  and see the result of that discrimination where entire communities have  been eviscerated. 

  Actions helped to uncover and fight back against auto finance lender  practices that used these subjective criteria, whether your name was  Rodriguez or Barack Obama Jones, to determine creditworthiness. This  practice was found to have a disproportionate impact, charging these  higher interest rates for minorities compared to White borrowers with  the exact, similar credit ratings. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, that argument is not a good argument because  when you think of the example of just, say, Morgan Stanley, if there  was someone who, in Detroit, Michigan, lost their house through the  subprime lending, that has as much impact on that person as the person  next door who was underwater and couldn't sell their home and couldn't  repair it because of the impact on their next-door neighbor. 

  This notion that they have to be injured in exactly the same way  really flies in the face of logic and, of course, flies in the face of  justice. 

  I would ask Members to adopt my amendment. It is common sense. It is  just. There are so many cases against minorities, in particular, that  would be adversely impacted through this legislation. 

  I yield back the balance of my time.

  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.

  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt pay equity  lawsuits arising from title VII of the Civil Rights Act or the Equal  Pay Act. 

  Today, the wage gap for women is a very real experience, not only for  those women, but for families in the United States workforce. According  to the National Women's Law Center, the gender wage gap amounts to over  $10,000 a year in median income. 

  But this bill, H.R. 1927, takes away one of the only effective tools  that women in the workplace have to narrow the wage gap. That is  through class action suits filed under title VII of the Civil Rights  Act or the Equal Pay Act. This bill would, to borrow Judge Posner's  term, really drive a stake through the heart of the Equal Pay Act or  the Civil Rights Act. 

  This bill will make it harder to certify members of a class in pay  equity  cases because each detail relating to the type and scope of the damage  is often unique to the woman who was injured. For example, a woman  involved in a class could have a different type of job, different  number of years working for a company, different wages, different  benefits, and if the company is discriminating against all women,  across all the job categories, they would not be certified as a class  unless they made exactly the same pay, worked there exactly the same  number of years, which, Mr. Chairman, is ludicrous. 

  This bill would also make it harder for women in pay equity cases  because, at the certification stage, women wouldn't have the same  information about each other to know whether or not they could be in  the same class. 

  Mr. Chairman,  

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague for that  exhaustive explanation and definition of scope. 

  Common sense just ain't common, so we cannot rely on common sense. 

  I just want to say that the courts already require a plaintiff  seeking class action certification to make substantial showings that  they have, in fact, been injured. That is our argument, that they have  to have the same scope and that we need to reserve the benefits for  those at the top so that women who are discriminated against in a  firm--we are only concerned with those women who are going to lose the  most money because they didn't get a management position. We are not  going to be concerned with the women who worked in the janitorial  services and were discriminated against. 

  I think that there is a smoking gun here when you hear our opponents  make these furious arguments and regale us with definitions of scope,  where the courts have already done that. If it ain't broke, don't fix  it. 

  I yield back the balance of my time.

  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, I wish to clarify my position on Roll Call  Vote Number 12, cast on January 7, 2016. The vote was on passage of  H.R. 712, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of  2015, which would require an agency seeking to enter a covered consent  decree or settlement agreement to publish such decree or agreement in  the Federal Register and online not later than 60 days before it is  filed with the court. On passage of H.R. 712, I voted ``Aye.'' It was  my intention to vote ``No.'' 

  While I firmly believe in judicial transparency, I could not support  this legislation in its entirety. H.R. 712 included provisions that  place unreasonable burdens on our regulatory process and give undue  influence to certain groups. This legislation addressed pressing issues  with the efficacy and efficiency of our regulatory process; however, it  did not strike the right balance. That is why I ultimately decided to  oppose this legislation, and I would like to reflect this intent.

  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Senate  resolution S.J. Res. 22, introduced by my good friend and colleague  from Iowa, Senator Ernst, to express my disapproval of the  Environmental Protection Agency power grab through an expansive  definition of the Waters of the United States (WOTUS). 

  The WOTUS rule gives more control to federal agencies, like the EPA  and the Army Corp of Engineers, while stripping authority from those  who know our natural resources best such as farmers, ranchers, and  state regulatory authorities. This is in direct contradiction of state  laws, Supreme Court rulings, and existing compact agreements and has  potentially devastasting consequences on our economy, our farmers, and  the small businesses that create jobs in the First District of Iowa. 

  I know the farmers and small businesses in my district do not want  the heavy hand of Washington micromanaging their lands--especially  without input from the state of Iowa. President Obama and the EPA must  realize increasing regulatory burdens and compliance costs will fail to  improve the water quality while only adding red tape for ordinary  folks. 

  Last year I voted for H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection  Act and I intend to vote again for S.J. Res. 22 to protect Iowa's land,  water and resources and to stop the executive overreach of the  suffocating Obama Administration.

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, I noted with particular joy  that the House Energy and Commerce Committee moved through, by  unanimous vote and complete bipartisanship, the Helping Families in  Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2426. 

  Without question, it is one of the most important pieces of  legislation to address the serious mental illness crisis that has  plagued our Nation since de-institutionialization turned millions of  seriously ill citizens out on our streets, assuming they could function  in the community in the second half of the 20th century. That proved  not to be possible for millions of our fellow citizens. 

  Lacking effective treatment, many froze to death in back alleys, sat  in their own excrement on the sidewalks of our cities, sought refuge  under bridges and in doorways and street grates, became victims of  abuse, and, too often, disappeared into the vapors of life, propelled  by the force of their own unquiet minds. 

  Let me thank profusely and recognize Congressman Tim Murphy of  Pennsylvania, a psychologist who relied on his three decades of  experience, and Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, a  psychiatric nurse with two decades of experience in practice, for their  visionary and unrelenting efforts to move the plight of the mentally  ill into the main arena of this Congress. 

  I urge the Speaker to swiftly allocate time for its advancement to  the House floor for a vote. Let us do something in our time and  generation worthy of being remembered. This bill is it.

53298,1095143,Isil,06/15/16,14,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 7 months ago ISIL terrorists massacred  130 civilians across the city of Paris, 6 months ago ISIL supporters  murdered more than a dozen Americans at a holiday party in San  Bernardino, 3 months ago ISIL bombings killed and maimed  indiscriminately in the heart of Europe, and then last month ISIL's  spokesman issued a chilling declaration of war against the Western  world. He called for attacks--specifically lone wolf attacks-- throughout the month of Ramadan in Europe and the United States. He  said:  

       Get prepared . . . to make it a month of calamity for the       nonbelievers. [T]he smallest action you do in their heartland       is better and more enduring to us than what you would do if       you were with us here.  

  On Sunday, a terrorist claiming allegiance to ISIL took 49 American  lives. The next day, an ISIL supporter in France murdered two people,  including an off-duty police officer. 

  We hope to learn more about the Orlando terrorist attack and the  depth of that particular terrorist's involvement with ISIL when  Senators are briefed later today by the FBI Director and the Homeland  Security Secretary. This much seems clear already: I do not believe  this was some random act of violence. It seems clear this was a cold- blooded murder committed by a terrorist who picked his targets with  deliberate malice, who pledged his allegiance to a group who stones gay  men and tosses them from rooftops, enslaves women, and crucifies  children. 

  ISIL is not the JV team; it is the personification of evil in our  world. ISIL is not contained, nor can it be. The way to prevent more  ISIL-inspired and ISIL-directed heartbreak is to defeat ISIL. This is  why we have repeatedly demanded a serious plan from the President to  defeat ISIL and have done what we can to fill the leadership vacuum he  has left. This is why we worked to strengthen law enforcement, rebuild  our military, and develop counterterrorism tools designed to save  lives. The terrorist attack in Orlando underlines the critical  importance of this work, and it presents each of us with a choice: Do  we want to make the tough choices to actually solve the problem and  defeat ISIL, or do we want to use the Senate floor to make a 30-second  political ad? 

  As I said, the principle way to defeat ISIL-inspired or ISIL-directed  attacks is to defeat ISIL inside Iraq and Syria. The President's  containment strategy, which has relied primarily upon a ground proxy  force of Syrian YPG Kurds, will not be sufficient to dislodge ISIL from  its headquarters in Raqqa or clear and hold ground in Arab parts of  Syria. 

  The next President must do much more, and there are steps we can take  today to help him or her succeed in that effort. The sweeping Defense  bill we passed yesterday represents a decisive step in the right  direction. Not only will it help prepare our next Commander in Chief,  it will help strengthen military readiness, better enable  servicemembers to confront threats, and help keep the American people  safer from an array of national security challenges. Passing that bill  sent a strong signal to our men and women in uniform, it sent a strong  signal to our allies, it sent a strong signal to our adversaries, but  there is more we can and must do. 

  This week, through the appropriations process, we will continue to  discuss ways we can shore up our efforts to fight terrorism. Several  Republican colleagues have already offered ideas on how we can do so.  Republicans have offered ideas to address the threat of lone wolf  attacks like the one we saw in Orlando. Republicans have offered ideas  to help connect the dots with respect to terrorists' communications.  Republicans have offered ideas to help disrupt terrorists' plans. These  are the kinds of things we have long advocated. They were important  before the horrific events this weekend and are all the more important  today. 

  By passing the underlying appropriations bill, we can provide the FBI  with more of the support it needs to follow leads generated here within  our borders. In the meantime, I encourage Senators to work with the  very capable  bill managers who crafted this legislation, the senior Senators from  Alabama and Maryland. If they have other effective ideas, talk to them  and try to make the bill even stronger. 

  This much is clear: We can choose to respond to terrorist attacks  after the damage is already done, or we can make it our goal to prevent  them in the first place. I know my choice. I am going to keep doing  what I can to prevent the pain and loss from terrorism. Our families  and communities are counting on us. Our freedoms and rights as  Americans are counting on it too. We must continue to do what is  necessary to seek out terrorist threats at every level and protect the  country we love.

  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, as we near its 100th  anniversary, I rise today to commend the cooperative owners and the  employees of the Farm Credit System for their continuing service in  meeting the credit and financial-services needs of rural communities  and agriculture. 

  I was pleased to cosponsor House Resolution 591, commending the  cooperative owners and employees of the Farm Credit System for 100  years of service. The legislation was introduced by House Agriculture  Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, Ranking Member Collin Peterson, as  well as the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee for  Commodity Exchanges, Energy & Credit, Chairman Austin Scott and Ranking  Member David Scott. 

  The Farm Credit System plays a vital role in the national success of  agriculture and the economic vibrancy of rural communities throughout  all 50 States and Puerto Rico, providing more than $237 billion in  loans to more than 500,000 customers. For example, in my home state of  Mississippi, Farm Credit serves 6,379 borrower-customers, providing  $1.2 billion in credit. 

  Farm Credit's mission also extends to supporting rural communities by  financing vital infrastructure, bringing clean water to rural  communities, providing reliable energy to farms and rural towns, and  offering modern high-speed telecommunications that connect rural  America to the rest of the world.

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Marcelle and I, along with all Vermonters,  were devastated by the news of the attack in Orlando, and our hearts go  out to the victims and their families. All Americans deserve to feel  safe in their communities regardless of their race, age, sex,  ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation. In the wake of the worst  mass shooting in American history, all of us must stand with the people  of Orlando who have been so shaken by this hateful act of terrorism and  violence. And in particular, as we celebrate Pride Month, we must stand  with and support the LGBT community, both in Orlando and throughout the  Nation. 

  We are so thankful for the law enforcement officers and first  responders who rushed to the scene in the middle of the night to  confront the killer and save lives. We also are grateful for the work  of the doctors and nurses who fought and continue to fight to save even  more. My wife, Marcelle, is a registered surgical nurse, and we have  been deeply moved to see the outpouring of support by people across  Florida and the country who are donating blood and doing what they can  to support the victims and their families. 

  In the wake of tragedies like this, whether the victims are members  of the LGBT community, African-American church parishioners, first  graders in an elementary school, college students, moviegoers, or  others in our community, we are called as Americans to come together in  solidarity. We come together in grief and in shock. We come together in  support of the victims, their families, law enforcement personnel and  first responders, and the entire community. And we come together to try  and find a way to prevent further acts of senseless violence. We are at  our best as a nation when we come together. When we are united in  strength and in courageous acts of selflessness and kindness, our  country can move forward with a greater sense of purpose and hope. 

  We must not allow ourselves to be divided by the bigoted actions of a  murderer or by any fear that the killer sought to foment. He took an  assault rifle into a nightclub, one that was known as a special place  in Orlando's LGBT community. He fired on a crowd of innocent, unarmed  people. This man was no fighter and certainly no soldier. This was  either the act of a murderous bigot trying to shroud his hatred by  professing allegiance to ISIL or the actions of a cowardly terrorist  seeking to paralyze and divide us with fear--or perhaps both. In either  case, we cannot let his heinous acts lead us to turn on one another. 

  Some are already using this horrific attack as an opportunity to  further divide us. The Republican Party's presumptive Presidential  nominee continues to peddle his corrosive rhetoric of fear by proposing  to ban all Muslims from entering the country. This week he went even  further by suggested that the entire Muslim American community was  somehow complicit in this heinous act. This is irresponsible fear- mongering--plain and simple. It is guilt by association. And it makes  us less safe. We should all condemn this bigotry and reject attempts to  foment fear and hatred. We are stronger and safer when we reject such  attempts to divide us. 

  The Republican standard bearer has also questioned the motivations  and patriotism of the President of the United States. These  insinuations are dangerous. They are beyond the pale, and I reject them  emphatically and categorically. I call on every Member of this body to  do the same. We are a better nation than this. 

  The American people are rightfully demanding action instead of  rhetoric. They are tired of hearing that the tragedy in Orlando and the  countless others we have endured are not about our gun laws. We must  recognize that we have a security weakness in this country and ISIL is  exploiting it. Our enemies know that in the United States you can go  online or to a gun show and buy a gun. You don't need to have  identification. No background check will be run. You can simply acquire  a semiautomatic weapon that can kill dozens of people in a matter of  minutes. 

  We must have universal background checks. That is simply common  sense. We have had background checks for decades. I am among millions  of responsible gun owners in this country who undergo background checks  when we purchase a firearm. And, like millions of responsible gun  owners, I understand that this check is necessary to help keep guns out  of the hands of criminals and terrorists. It is common sense that we  need to close the loopholes that allow people to evade background  checks altogether. And we must also make sure that the background  checks are effective. That means giving law enforcement the power to  stop  a suspected terrorist, or someone who has recently been under  investigation for terrorism, from buying a gun. It is also common sense  that assault weapons designed for the battlefield have no place on our  streets, in our schools, in our churches, or in our communities. I have  moved and supported an assault weapons ban for this simple reason. 

  These changes make sense, and they fix glaring vulnerabilities in our  system. This is not about politics. This is about keeping Americans  safe. This is about stepping up and taking action and not just  resigning ourselves to the repeated call for moments of silence,  tragedy after tragedy. I am a responsible gun owner, and I do not take  this issue lightly. I have fought for years to pass these commonsense  measures, and I will continue to do so. 

  Americans have shown throughout the course of history that we can  live up to the principles of freedom, equality, and liberty that have  guided us for so long. Now is the time to stand defiantly against the  petty politics of fear. Despite what others may say, we are a great  nation. Now is the time for Congress to act to pass commonsense  measures that have languished for too long and could save American  lives.

27069,1095147,Joseph Mussomeli Article,06/15/16,14,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, Joseph Mussomeli spent 35 years  in the U.S. Foreign Service, including serving as our Ambassador to  both Cambodia and Slovenia. 

  Ambassador Mussomeli wrote a column for The Washington Post, which,  frankly, I am very surprised that the paper published in its June 10  edition. I would like to quote at length from this very important  column. 

  Ambassador Mussomeli wrote as follows:  

       Most of my former colleagues at the State Department will       be appalled by the assertion, but much of the media-fed angst       about Donald Trump's dearth of foreign policy expertise is       contrived. 

       Our cadre of neoconservative foreign policy experts,       unhumbled after marching us into a reckless war in Iraq and a       poorly conceived one in Afghanistan, who applauded as we       bombed Libya and bitterly resent our having failed to bomb       Syria, are frightened. 

       Wisely, they often focus on comments that Trump has made on       issues that are of less genuine interest to them. But what       really troubles them is his generally level-headed and       unmessianic attitude untoward foreign affairs. Trump has no       desire to make the rest of the world in our image. 

       The neocons bemoan Trump's rejection of a global role for       the United States, but Trump has no intent to withdraw the       United States from the world stage. He only rejects the       wanton use of our young men and women on foreign adventures       of questionable value. 

       The neocons have two clear foreign policy objectives, and       Trump may grant them neither. For many of them, their deepest       yearning is an air campaign against Iran. 

       Trump doesn't like the Iran nuclear agreement, but his       instinct is to make a better deal rather than attacking,       while Hillary Clinton has a strong record of supporting the       prodigal misuse of military force. 

       Clinton is just another neocon, though wrapped in sheep's       clothing. But clothing makes a huge difference. Most       Americans don't want the United States to be disrespected,       and they want a muscular military that doesn't take any       nonsense--but they also don't want military adventurism. 

       Trump succeeds in having it both ways: he reassures that       the United States will be respected and also that we will not       employ our troops as cannon fodder on distant battlefields. 

       Underneath all the tirades against illegal immigration and       the need to be tough with our adversaries, there is an inward       focus. There is a sense that America--in order to be great       again--needs to relinquish its role as global cop and tend       first to its needs at home. 

       By sounding caustic, Trump is able to appear more       militaristic and tougher than the far more reckless Clinton.       Calculating and cavalier, Clinton would agree with her old       pal, then-U.N. Ambassador Madeline Albright, ``What's the       point of having this superb military . . . if we can't use       it?'' The stern rebuke to that question later provided by       General Colin Powell that the military is not a toy is lost       on the neocons and Clinton. Among Clinton's weaknesses, her       fear of appearing weak may be her most damning. 

       The second neocon priority? A new cold war with Russia.       Vladimir Putin, unlikable and increasingly uncooperative and       antagonistic, admittedly makes this objective more within       reach, but Trump might avoid it as well. Clinton repeats over       and over that Russia only understands a tough and determined       opponent, while Trump may have a more sophisticated and       mature approach. 

       Far less petulant than most of the former Republican       candidates, Trump says he would       actually talk with Putin. That takes real courage, given the       general view among Republican elites. 

       Contrast that with Clinton, who thinks we should not be       talking too much to Putin and that we ought to further expand       NATO because, in her view, Russia would be an even greater       threat had it not been for NATO expansion. Of course, to       admit that NATO expansion triggered the current crisis would       be admitting that her husband is largely responsible for it. 

       Trump seems to understand George Kennan's warning that NATO       expansion would directly lead to a more paranoid and       aggressive Russia. 

       Trump, for all his bizarre commentary on domestic issues,       better grasps the subtleties of global politics and the       dangers of thinking ourselves infallible and invincible. 

       It is quite an irony: The ostensibly more reckless,       infantile, inexperienced and bombastic candidate may actually       be more mature, level-headed, and reasonable on foreign       policy than his critics who, against all the good advice our       parents gave us as children, pout and refuse to talk to those       they don't like, escalate arguments to violence when they are       upset, lack any remorse for the harm caused by their past       opinions and actions, and fail repeatedly to see that there       might be two sides to any disagreement.  

  Mr. Speaker, I think these words of Ambassador Mussomeli should be  considered very seriously by all of our Members.

  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House stood to bow our  heads in a moment of silence for gun violence on the House floor for  the 27th time since the horrific shooting of children at Sandy Hook  Elementary; this time, for the unspeakable murders that took place in  Orlando. 

  A moment of silence for gun violence; that is what we do. We have  stood, and we have prayed. 

  One time, I stood up and said: Now, let's do something. We are not  short of solutions. 

  The American people cannot believe that the Republicans have voted  against a bill that says that people on the suspected terrorist watch  list should not be able to buy guns. That is right. They would not  support that law. They won't support a ban on assault weapons that have  no other purpose than to kill people. 

  Enough is enough. That silence is a deafening silence. We cannot  stand to do that anymore without taking real action.

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 120th  Anniversary of the Twin Shaft Mining Disaster in Pittston,  Pennsylvania. Fifty-eight miners lost their lives during a massive  cave-in, most of whom were boys and men of Lithuanian and Irish  descent. Their memories will be honored June 25, 2016 at Our Lady of  the Eucharist Parish in Pittston. 

  In the early hours of June 28, 1896, miners from the Newton Coal  Company were at work in the Red Ash Vein of the Twin Shaft Mine. During  the shift, two hundred acres inside of the mine collapsed, trapping the  crew of workers four hundred feet underground. Volunteers were quickly  assembled to respond to the crisis. Attempts were made to excavate two  tunnels in an effort to bring the miners to safety. However, rescue  efforts proved to be futile and the victims' bodies were never  recovered. The tragic event remains one of the largest coal mining  disasters in Pennsylvania history. 

  A formal investigation of the cause of the disaster was opened by  Pennsylvania Governor Daniel H. Hastings on July 10, 1896. Testimony  indicated that the mine pillars displayed signs of instability in the  weeks leading up to the accident. The investigation commission first  issued its safety recommendations on September 25, 1896. The  commission's findings helped make a strong case for better safety  standards and workers' rights for mine workers. 

  It is a solemn responsibility of northeastern Pennsylvania civic  leaders and citizens to honor and remember those who perished in the  Twin Shaft Mine Disaster. As the Greater Pittston area marks the 120th  Anniversary of this tragedy, may we never forget the sacrifices made by  our coal mine workers and all they have contributed to our nation's  economic success.

  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Marine Corps  Captain Jeff Kuss. Captain Kuss was a native of Durango, CO where he  attended Durango High School and graduated from Ft. Lewis College with  a degree in economics. His life was tragically cut short during a  training accident on June 2, 2016 while he and the other Blue Angel  pilots were practicing for an air show near Smyrna, Tennessee. Captain  Kuss was a loving family man and is survived by his wife Christina  Ferrarese Kuss, their two young children Calvin and Sloan, and his  parents Michael and Janet of Durango.    Captain Kuss possessed a passion for aviation which took root at a  young age. After a great deal of hard work and perseverance, he became  one of the Navy's most talented pilots, being selected in 2014 to join  the elite Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron. The Blue Angels are one  of the world's most renowned squadrons, representing the men and women  who serve in the nation's Armed Forces and showcasing the incredible  training, skill and capability of our nation's elite military pilots.  Since 1946, the Blue Angels have inspired patriotism and wonder in  millions of fascinated spectators. Each pilot is hand-picked by current  members of the squadron to join--a selection process that is a  testament to the respect that his colleagues had for the talent and  ability Captain Kuss possessed.    The entire Durango community is incredibly proud of Captain Kuss for  his service to our nation and what he was able to achieve. When he was  brought home to rest in Durango citizens lined the streets to pay their  respects to this fallen hero, a testament to Captain Kuss' service,  deep ties to the community and a life well-lived. The host of active  duty members that have and continue to pay tribute to Captain Kuss are  a tribute to the many lives he impacted over the course of his career.    Mr. Speaker, Captain Jeff Kuss exemplified the very best of  Colorado's Third Congressional District and of the brave men and women  who risk all in service to our nation each day. We honor his service  and memory, and offer our condolences and prayers for his family and  friends. May they find peace during this most difficult time.

  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  the ranking member, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave  
BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 783 provides for further  consideration of H.R. 5293, the Department of Defense Appropriations  Act. The resolution provides for a structured rule and makes in order  75 amendments. The rule also provides suspension authority for  Thursday. 

  I want to kick off today's debate by making one thing very clear: the  underlying bill is a very good bill. I know some of my colleagues may  have some things to say that they would want to have added or a few  things they would want to see changed. But all things considered, this  is a very good bill. Let me tell you why. 

  This bill provides funding for the entire United States military,  including critical funding to help fight the Islamic State and others  who wish to do us harm. This bill ensures that our military receives  the 2.1 percent pay raise they deserve, instead of the 1.6 percent pay  raise requested by President Obama. 

  An important function of our military is research and development of  new technologies and weapons systems, so this bill provides funding for  those efforts. This bill makes important investments in military  readiness by providing for equipment procurement for each of the  service branches. We are sending far too many of our servicemembers  into harm's way with outdated or damaged equipment, so this bill also  includes much-needed funding for maintenance operations. 

  This bill also includes vital funding for the Defense Health Program,  which provides care for our troops, while also spurring investment in  important areas like traumatic brain injuries, cancer research, suicide  prevention programs, and sexual assault prevention and response. 

  Now, I seriously doubt that any of my colleagues disagree with those  functions. So this should be a bipartisan bill that passes with  overwhelming support, especially considering all that is going on in  the world today. 

  Just look at what happened this past weekend in Orlando. A person  influenced by radical Islamic terrorists took the lives of innocent  Americans. 

  Well, this bill includes funding to help fight the groups and  organizations like the Islamic State that are spreading this  radicalization. This bill is critical if we are to defeat the radical  organization that is spreading terror all around the globe. 

  Sadly, Mr. Speaker, I expect that today's debate will focus little on  what is actually in this bill. I fear that today's debate will result  in conversations about things that have absolutely nothing to do with  the United States military. That is a real shame, because this bill is  so very important. 

  I know some of my colleagues are going to express concerns about  procedure and the fact that this is a structured rule. So I want to  share some quick facts with you. More importantly, this rule makes in  order 75 amendments out of 105 submitted to the Rules Committee. Forty- three of these amendments--over half--are Democrat and bipartisan  amendments. 

  Mr. Speaker, we hear a lot of talk here about regular order. Well,  regular order means that the House works. Regular order doesn't mean  chaos. Regular order doesn't mean that Members get to offer poison pill  amendments just to kill a bill. Regular order is about ensuring we can  do the business that the American people elected us to do and that they  expect us to do. 

  Let's be real for a second. Only in Washington are people debating or  worried about whether a bill to fund our troops comes to the floor  under a structured rule or an open rule. 

  You know what people are worried about in homes from Maine to Hawaii?  They are worried about the safety and security of their families. 

  So let's not get caught up, especially on this bill, in political  games. The men and women who put their lives on the line each and every  day to keep us safe deserve better than that. And the American people  deserve better than that. 

  I urge my colleagues to support this rule and this bill.  


  I appreciate the gentlewoman's positive words about the underlying  bill. She pointed out a number of things about this bill that are very  good indeed. 

  I hear that she disagrees with the use of the overseas contingency  account for funding part of what is going on here, but we are in a war.  We are in a war overseas, and we are going to have to use that account  to fight that war overseas. 

  I also heard her say that we need to do more than just have a moment  of silence, as we did the other night. Acting on this bill does  something very important to stop terrorists over there from coming over  here and harming us, or to stop terrorists over there from being able  to inspire some of our own citizens to attack us. I have said many  times, if you want to stop terrorism in the United States, it is better  to defeat them over there. The underlying bill does that. It has been  worked out carefully, in a bipartisan fashion, as the gentlewoman said,  with the Department of Defense, so that they have what they need to  protect us, because the most important way to stop violence from  terrorists hitting us here at home is to make sure those terrorists are  destroyed abroad. 

  I am glad the gentlewoman from New York brought up the issue of open  rules. To have this debate, I think it is important to look at the  minority's record when it comes to openness and fairness on  appropriations bills. 

  When the gentlewoman was chair of the Rules Committee in the 111th  Congress, they also had a structured rule for the Department of Defense  Appropriations. So how many amendments did they make in order? Fifteen.  This bill makes in order 75 amendments to the Defense Appropriations  bill. That is a pretty stark difference, Mr. Speaker. 

  Let's not just look at the Defense Appropriations legislation. On the  Energy and Water bill, which this House considered under an open rule a  few weeks ago, the Democrat majority considered it under a structured  rule and made just 21 amendments in order. 

  What about the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill in  fiscal year 2010? The gentlewoman made just eight amendments in order.  The House considered the same bill earlier this year under an open  rule. 

  A few more numbers for you from fiscal year 2010. Only 5 amendments  were made in order through the Labor,  Health and Human Services bill, just 23 for Transportation, Housing and  Urban Development Appropriations, 17 for Financial Services, and 1-- only 1--amendment to the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. 

  Then, for fiscal year 2011, under the Democrat majority, only two  appropriations bills were presented to the House, both under structured  rules. They were considered, and then they just stopped the  appropriations process altogether. 

  Mr. Speaker, it is easy to talk a big game about open rules and the  importance of fairness; but, if you look at the record, it is clear  that this House has been much more open and much fairer under  Republican leadership. 

  Our Conference wanted to restore open rules in the appropriations  process; however, the minority has abused the process, and we have no  choice but to take the steps necessary to ensure we can get the  business of the American people done. 


  I really appreciate my friend from Maryland who, recently, he and I  had an opportunity to spend some time together. I have enjoyed his  company, and I recognize that he is a man of great experience and  wisdom. I do have some differences with him on some of his remarks,  however. 

  He mentioned the Guantanamo Bay provision. It has recently come to  light that the White House has now admitted that some of the Guantanamo  Bay detainees that have been released are now back on the battlefield  trying to kill American servicemen and -women. So, for those of us on  this side of the aisle, that is not acceptable. We don't want more  Guantanamo Bay detainees out there putting our men and women in harm's  way. We want to keep them where they are, to keep our men and women in  uniform safe. 

  He talked about a funding cliff. What he is referring to is that this  takes us, on the OCO account, into next spring, to when we will have a  new President in place and, at that time, we can put in the rest of the  funding. 

  Now, this is exactly what was done 8 years ago when we were having a  transition from the Bush administration to the Obama administration. At  that time, then-Senator Obama, then-Senator Kerry, both voted for that,  both supported that. So all we are doing now is the same thing we did 8  years ago. It is common sense. It was perfectly okay with them then; it  is not now. 

  And then on the Maloney amendment, I know exactly what the gentleman  is talking about. The other side asked for that amendment. It was  adopted by the House. It was put in the bill, and then when the bill  itself, with the amendment on it, came up for a vote, only six  Democrats voted for it. I voted for the bill with the language in it.  The Democrats voted and killed the bill that had the antidiscriminatory  language that they feel so strongly about. 

  So let's understand what is really going on here. This is not an  effort to do anything about discrimination. This is an effort to bring  an end to the appropriations process, to throw a rock in the gears of  what we have got to do to make government work for the American people.  And our side of the aisle, the majority, is simply not going to allow  that to happen. We are going to do the work that the American people  sent us here to do; we are going to use structured rules; we are going  to bring order out of chaos; and we are going to get the people's work  done. 


  Mr. Speaker, my colleague from the Rules Committee is exactly right.  We made in order his amendment that would allow him to have a debate on  this floor on the AUMF. I also agree with him that it is probably not  enough time to have a full debate on the AUMF. We talked about this  several times in the Rules Committee, and he and I have a common  understanding of the need for us to have a full debate on this floor on  an AUMF. I agree with the gentleman, so we made his amendment in order. 

  I think he would like for us to go beyond that and actually bring an  AUMF itself to the floor so we could have a fuller debate. When the  time is right--and I don't know when that is going to be--I am going to  be supportive of that. I have written letters in that respect, so I  believe in that. 

  I want to point out to him that we made his amendment in order. We  made his amendment in order and 74 others. That is 60 more amendments  that were made in order on the Defense Appropriations bill than when  the Democrats were in control of this House. So I have heard enough  about this closed debate, closed rules. We have a structured rule to  bring order out of chaos, and we have allowed many, many, many more  amendments than the Democrats ever allowed on appropriations bills. 

  This is a good rule. It is a fair and balanced rule that allows for a  full debate on issues. Some of these amendments I don't agree with, Mr.  Speaker, but I thought they should be made in order, as did everybody  else in the Rules Committee who voted for the rule. I know the  Democrats didn't. This is a good rule, and I hope that we will adopt  this rule and move forward with the debate on these important issues. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I do not. 


  Mr. Speaker, I listened very intently to the gentlewoman, and I do  want to say this to her and to all of my colleagues in the House: The  American people are worried. They are fearful, and they are fearful  because there are people in other places who want to come here and do  us harm simply because we are different from them. We are Christians,  or we are a different type of Muslim from them, or we are LGBT, or we  believe in all the principles that make America great. They want to  come here and destroy all of us. 

  The attack on Sunday was an attack on every citizen of the United  States of America. People are fearful that those terrorists will come  here or they will find more people who are here now and inspire them to  do the horrendous act that we saw done Saturday night, early Sunday  morning. 

  They want us to defend them. We defend them by authorizing and  appropriating the money to pay for the activities of the Armed Forces  of the United States of America. That is what this bill is about. That  is what we should be debating. That is what the people of the United  States want us to do. 

  So we have put together a rule that is going to get the people's work  done and provide the money to defend them from people that would harm  us. That is the least we could do in reaction to what happened the  other night, but it is a very, very important step for the people of  this country. 

  Mr. Speaker, I, again, urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  783 and the underlying bill. 

  The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 783 Offered by Ms. Slaughter  

       At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections: 

       Sec. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney       General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of       firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected       dangerous terrorist. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill. 

       Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1076.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means  

       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating. 

       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.'' 

       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.'' 

       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S.  It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York, our  ranking member, for yielding me the time. 

  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against this  restrictive rule. The gentleman from Alabama talks about a poison pill.  The poison pill amendment he is talking about is an amendment that  would prohibit discrimination against the LGBT community. That is the  poison pill. It is pathetic that an anti-discrimination measure would  be considered a poison pill, but only in this Republican-controlled  House would that be the case. 

  I would also say to the gentleman that the last time I checked,  Republicans have the majority in this place. You have 247; we have 188.  You can do whatever you want to do. That is why we see these  restrictive rules one after another after another coming before the  House. 

  When I hear that we are limiting the appropriations amendment process  only to get rid of poison pills, there are other amendments that I  don't think would be considered poison pills that were denied. My  colleague from California, Jackie Speier, had an amendment dealing with  littoral combat ships. That was not made in order. If we had an open  rule under the appropriations process that we should have had, that we  were promised, she could have offered her amendment. But that was  denied as well. 

  In terms of how the whole bill is funded with this overseas  contingency account, it is one gimmick after another. It is  embarrassing to try to defend this OCO account and how my colleagues  have tried to get around the budget caps by going in and taking money  to lift up the overall amounts in the base bill. 

  But here is the deal: I will say that I am grateful that an amendment  was made in order that I authored along with Congressman Jones and many  of my other colleagues that would basically say that it is about time  Congress has a debate and a vote on an AUMF. We are at war in Syria,  and we are at war in Iraq again. Our troops are in combat situations.  That is the way the Secretary of Defense describes it. Our troops are  being wounded. We have lost soldiers in these recent battles, and we  have not had the courage in this institution to actually debate these  wars and to vote up or down on whether we should continue these wars. 

  My friends have all kinds of excuses why we can't do this. First they  say: Well, the White House has to come up with a plan. 

  The White House did. 

  Now it is: Well, we can't debate this because it is a delicate time. 

  We should have debated these wars before we entered these wars, yet  the leadership of this House prevented us time and time again. 

  Now we have 10 minutes, 5 on both sides, to debate this amendment.  But my amendment is very simple. It basically says no AUMF, no money.  If we don't have the courage to have this debate and to authorize these  wars, then our troops ought to come home. It is that simple. It is  very, very straightforward. For the life of me, I can't understand why  anybody would vote against this.

  Mr. McGOVERN. If some of my colleagues want to expand these wars,  then this is the opportunity for you to do it. If some of my  colleagues, like me, want to lessen our military footprint in the  Middle East, this is the opportunity. But to do nothing is  unconscionable, and voting for this would force us--would force us--to  do our job and to live up to our constitutional responsibility. 

  We cannot hide behind all these excuses anymore. There is no more  excuse. Our brave men and women are in harm's way. The least we can do  is show them that we care enough about what is going on to have this  debate and vote on an AUMF. 

  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both side of the aisle to vote  for the McGovern-Jones amendment. Vote to force this House to have a  debate and a vote on an AUMF. If not, let us bring our troops back home  to safety with their families.

26991,1095153,"Providing for Further Consideration of H.R. Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017",06/15/16,14,"
  Mr. Speaker, despite Speakers Boehner and Ryan promising that the  Chamber would be open, we haven't had an open rule since Speaker Ryan  became Speaker. He has closed down the legislative process, shutting  out Members and, thus, their constituents. 

  We need a full, open debate process, and though Speaker Ryan had the  best of intentions when he assumed the mantle, his best laid plans have  already crumbled and the Chamber has been slowed to a halt so  Republicans can avoid taking difficult votes. 

  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us provides appropriations for the  Department of Defense at a level $3 billion above fiscal year 2016,  though it still remains $587 million below the President's request. 

  There are some strong, bipartisan measures in the bill, including  funding for research into traumatic brain injuries, cancer, and  physiological health research, as well as sexual assault prevention  funds. Those are welcome investments. 

  Also included is a well-deserved pay raise for our men and women in  uniform. Their immense sacrifice cannot be quantified, and they deserve  our wholehearted support for the tireless defense of our Nation. 

  Additionally, the bill provides robust funding for cybersecurity and  sorely needed assistance for our friends struggling for democracy in  Ukraine so they can get the training and equipment they need to defend  themselves against Russian aggression. 

  One of the most important aspects of this bill, however, is the  investment made in the Department's manufacturing technology programs.  That is the wave of the future, Mr. Speaker. We have no way to achieve  national security if we cannot manufacture the goods that we need here  at home. 

  The Manufacturing Technology Office administers the soon to be eight  DOD-led Manufacturing Innovation Institutes that allow us to secure  technological advantage and economic competitiveness around the world. 

  I am proud that one of these institutes, AIM Photonics, is included,  and that this bill fully funds the institute's launch with $25 million  of the total $110 million committed by the Federal Government. I thank  the chair and the ranking member for making our Nation's industrial  policy a bipartisan priority. 

  However, these essential pieces of funding are overshadowed by the  way in which the House majority has decided to source their funds. They  do so by raiding the overseas contingency operations, or OCO, which is  meant to be emergency supplemental funding. 

  This budget gimmick makes it even more likely that the Department of  Defense will run out of funding early next year as we will come to  another standoff over funding.   

  This is robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it is not how any rational  citizen would run a household budget. And why would the House majority  endorse it? 

  The discussion and debate, while essential, detract from the urgency  of addressing the war at home, the gun violence epidemic that is  crippling our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today heartbroken from the  horrific loss of life due to gun violence in America, but this Chamber  keeps turning and churning, and going about business as usual. 

  On Monday night, as so many of my colleagues said, we held yet  another moment of silence. Since there have been 998 mass shootings in  the United States since Newtown, that is a lot of moments of silence,  but no action at all. 

  How many times do we have to stand on the floor and observe that  silence when our colleagues who actually have the power to make the  changes necessary to stop it are in the room with us? 

  For the victims of Orlando and every shooting before, for their  families and our constituents, we need more than thoughts and prayers.  We need action and laws now. 

  Mr. Speaker, according to the United Nations, half of the world's  guns are in the United States. We have 317 million people in our  Nation, but an estimated 350 million guns. If you think that the  ubiquity of firearms in our Nation has not increased the likelihood of  mass shootings, I encourage you to reconsider. 

  What happened in Orlando was a man with a military weapon shot  without pause for heaven knows how long a time because he had a weapon.  The fact that he had that--and we have said over and over again that  those guns are only intended to kill people, and, unfortunately, that  has come true, and it is our citizens that they are killing. 

  Now, we, the Members of this body, could vote for lifesaving,  commonsense measures, yet the majority refuses to act. The majority  blocks votes to prevent terrorists from buying guns. A terrorist on a  watch list can go ahead and buy a gun. 

  They won't consider legislation to require universal background  checks, which the majority of Americans support. They won't even  consider, anymore, the assault weapons ban. Before it expired, it made  a lot of difference in the mass killings in this country. 

  What is even more dangerous is that, in the healthcare bill passed-- it was stunning to me that it was even in there--the Centers for  Disease Control can't even track data on gun violence as a public  health issue. Also, family doctors, who can ask about drugs in the  home, are not allowed to ask about guns in the home; and some gun sales  records are destroyed after 24 hours, by law, making it incredibly  hard, if not impossible, to verify information and to track sales. 

  So that is the state of affairs in this Chamber today. Instead of  thoughts and prayers, which we always turn to for solace, we would like  to have, now, some actions and laws. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, let me take just a minute to say that I  appreciate the history lesson, but the fact is that both Speaker  Boehner and Speaker Ryan had said that this was going to be the most  open Congress in history, but we haven't had a single open rule since  Speaker Ryan took over. So I think we could go on in this debate like a  tennis match all day long, but the facts are the facts. 

  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased now to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democrat whip. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask if my colleague has  further speakers. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Then I am prepared to close. 

  Mr. Speaker, my colleague says that some amendments he likes, some he  doesn't. That is perfectly legitimate, but that is not why we make  amendments in order in the Rules Committee. We don't pick out some we  like and some we don't. We talk about the germaneness of the  amendments. Certainly, if you have 70, I am sure there are going to be  several people do not agree with. 

  But there is beginning to be a very unpleasant trend--and I am very  concerned about it--that members of the majority on the Rules Committee  will ask people coming to ask to have their amendments made in order-- which, remember, as far as I can say right now, and I could be proved  wrong, I think we are the only committee where members of a committee  come up and ask for something. It is a totally different process from  what happens in the other committees.  

  They come to us with full understanding--of course, the ratio, as you  know, is 9-4, so it is kind of window dressing a lot of time--to ask  that an amendment be in order. Those are sometimes people from the  committee whose amendments weren't made in order in the committee, or  it is other Members who have a great interest in that bill and would  like to express the interest of their constituents in it. 

  But there is no question that there is really beginning to be a  trend: if they don't like the amendment themselves, it is out the  window. There is no chance of debate. In fact, so few of us get a  chance to do any debating that we believe--and think that it is a  fact--that many of our constituents in the country are just shut out of  the debate. 

  What is even worse than that, now members have begun to ask the  witnesses, as they come with their amendments: If we make your  amendment in order, will you vote for the bill? 

   We are just getting into it, and I  really want to study, but there is a quid pro  quo there that I don't believe is intended for members of the Rules  Committee to have. 

  There is a favoritism being asked: If we do this for you, not because  it is good, it is germane, it should move the bill and because, as a  Member of Congress, you have a right to do it; but if we grant you this  wish, your obligation is to vote for the bill, even though you may hate  everything else that is in it. 

  So we will amplify on that a little bit. We have some review to do on  how that is going to work, but on the face of it, I find it totally  offensive myself. 

  Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity now to make a meaningful change,  as all my colleagues have said, to address the gun violence epidemic  that is crippling our Nation. 

  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up bipartisan legislation that would bar the sale of  firearms and explosives to those on the FBI's terrorist watch list. 

  No matter how hard I might try--and I don't plan to--I don't believe  I could find any kind of cogent argument that would argue against that.  I think a thinking person would say: Yes, someone on the FBI's  terrorist list, we would not like them to be collecting firearms and  explosives. 

  It is unconscionable that the Republican majority has repeatedly  refused to even debate closing such a glaring loophole. In fact, in our  discussions about that and shouldn't that be done--as I said, the  public really wants that done--they won't even consider it. 

  The country can't wait any longer for Congress to act. I think the  whole country is absolutely paralyzed with sadness, anger, and mixed  feelings about what is going on in this country. The number of people  shot in a weekend in Chicago; the young singer the other night, just  before the Orlando massacre, who was shot to death because somebody  wanted to do it and had the ability to do it. 

  We have Second Amendment rights, but we also have rights to live. We  have the right to think that when our children go to school in the  morning, they are going to come home in the afternoon. I can assure you  that all the people worshiping in Mother Emmanuel Church believed they  were going to go home after that to supper and to bed and to look  forward to the next day. 

  We are not sensibly looking at what is going on here. Our record  internationally is appalling. I will tell you that the country, I  believe, at this moment is really crying out for something, and I am  afraid, again, it will fall on deaf ears. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and  defeat the previous question so that we can do an amendment on guns and  to vote ``no'' on the rule.

26890,1095154,"Providing for Further Consideration of H.R. Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017",06/15/16,14,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 

  I tell my friend, Bradley Byrne, I would love to have a discussion  with him on that issue that he raised, but I don't have the time to do  it now because I want to speak about the bill.  

  First, let me thank Chairman Frelinghuysen, who is the chairman of  the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and Mr. Visclosky. They have  worked together. They worked positively, and America can be proud of  their leadership. Both of them have been extraordinary advocates for  our military and men and women who serve. 

  This rule presents a rejection, however, of the regular order Speaker  Ryan promised in the House. He promised it. That is the issue, not a  question of how many. What he said was this was going to be open. 

  As soon as it became clear, however, that the House Republicans might  have to take an up-or-down vote again on whether to ban discrimination  against LGBT Americans, they shut the open appropriations process down.  And, in fact, when we adopted that amendment, a majority of the  Republican Members voted against their own bill. That was the abuse of  the system, I tell my friend, not anything we have done over here. 

  No transparency, no open process, no regular order, no scruples about  denying Americans' Representatives the chance to add their input in  this Defense bill, simply because they want to allow discrimination  against LGBT Americans. That is what this is about. That is how we got  to this closed rule or structured rule. Make no mistake about it. 

  In rejecting the Maloney amendment last month and now closing the  process as a result of losing the Energy and Water bill because it did  not allow discrimination, House Republicans are feeding the same kind  of anti-LGBT sentiment that makes gay, lesbian, bisexual, and  transgender Americans feel unsafe in our country and creates an  environment which furthers racism, homophobia, and xenophobia. That is  tough language. I get it. 

  Speaker Ryan had said he would allow the House to work its will. That  was his pledge. He told Roll Call in November that the Republican  leadership would not ``predetermine the outcome of everything around  here.'' 

  Well, in this instance, the House is being steered in a very  deliberate direction by the Speaker and the leader. The Republican  leadership, once again, is more concerned with keeping its Members from  having to vote on LGBT discrimination than on maintaining the open  process that it promised. Each and every Member of this House ought to  be not only willing but eager to cast their votes to say,  unequivocally, we are against discrimination. 

  Let me be clear. There are many provisions in this bill that I  support, but there are a number about which I have serious concerns. My  concerns include the dangerous act of setting up a funding cliff next  year that would put our troops in danger. 

  In their attempt to get around the funding caps both parties agreed  to last year, House Republicans pretend that they are keeping the deal  we made, but, in reality, they are raiding the account that provides  our troops with the resources they need to do their jobs safely. 

  This bill also includes restrictions on the Pentagon's ability to  transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees as well as, once again, abandoning  military-civilian pay parity in cost-of-living increases. 

  The American public, Mr. Speaker, ought to know it costs $5 million  per incarceree at Guantanamo, $5 million per person. How many  terrorists have escaped from American prisons? Zero. Zero. 

  Now there is a Republican amendment to ban DREAMers from serving in  uniform, a discriminatory provision in this bill. 

  Because the process has been shut down, Mr. Speaker, Democrats have  been severely limited in our ability to put forward amendments to  improve this bill and address these concerns. We will continue,  however, to push hard to ensure all our troops have the tools they need  to succeed at their mission and come home safely, and we will keep  asking the House to take a vote to end discrimination. We must not rest  until all Americans are truly equal under the laws and Constitution our  men and women in uniform put their lives at risk to defend.

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the late  racing legend Raymond Parks upon his induction into the eighth class of  the NASCAR Hall of Fame. 

  If it weren't for men like Raymond Parks, there is no doubt the  racing industry as we know it would not exist today. Mr. Parks was a  pivotal player in both the development and expansion of NASCAR since  its inception. 

  After serving his country during WWII, Mr. Parks returned to the  United States where he had begun a career as a stock-car owner before  the war. In 1947, he attended a meeting in Daytona Beach, Florida that  would change racing forever. Sitting around the table with other  drivers and promoters, they agreed that racing could not grow without a  formal organization to create rules and give their sport structure. As  a result, NASCAR was born. 

  From then on Raymond Parks remained an influential member in  motorsports. Known for being the first successful team owner in racing,  he won the first NACSCAR title ever in 1948. He would continue to work  alongside his original team to dominate the sport until his retirement.  Even though Mr. Parks passed away in 2010, his legacy lives on and will  now be preserved forever in the NASCAR Hall of Fame. 

  This year's class was selected by a comprehensive voting panel that  included track owners, retired competitors, industry leaders, members  of the media, and a nationwide fan vote. In total, a group of five was  chosen to join the ranks of other NASCAR legends in the Hall of Fame.  Mr. Parks is extremely deserving of this honor and will now be  enshrined forever for his contributions to the sport. 

  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring Raymond Parks, a 2017  inductee of the NASCAR Hall of Fame

We are currently working toward an agreement that will  allow us to go to conference with the House and work out the final  legislation. 

  We have all seen the toll this heroin and prescription opioid crisis  has taken on our home States. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see the  continuing impact in Kentucky.

He is the  loving husband of Stacy Blakes and an outstanding father to his two  daughters. Bishop Samuel Blakes is the youngest son of Bishop Blakes,  Sr. and has been pastoring for more than 21 years.    He and his brother Bishop Robert Blakes, Jr. serve as Co-Pastors at  the New Home Family Worship Center, a ministry encompassing six  locations across Louisiana and Texas. Bishop Samuel Blakes has the  pleasure of serving as Pastor to both the New Orleans and Baton Rouge  Ministries.    Bishop Samuel Blakes was called to ministry at a young age when he  attended St. Augustine High School in New Orleans. His work in ministry  began when he received his Bachelors of Theology from Christian Bible  College of Louisiana and then went on to receive his Master's Degree in  theology from the same institution. His dedication and love of God has  allowed him to travel across the U.S. and abroad to spread the word of  God. Not only does he travel to spread his message, but he and his  brother, Bishop Robert Blakes, Jr. host their own weekly television  show.

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate  racing legend, and my friend, Rick Hendrick upon his induction into the  eighth class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. 

  A native of Warrenton, North Carolina, Rick Hendrick was born with  racing in his blood. At an early age his father, ``Papa Joe'' Hendrick,  instilled in Rick the value of a hard day's work and a love of  automobiles. At the age of 14, he made a name for himself by shattering  speed records at the local drag strip. 

  After purchasing a Chevrolet dealership, he quickly found success  which led to the creation of Hendrick Automotive Group--the largest  privately held dealership in the country. In 1984, he founded All-Star  Racing which would eventually become Hendrick Motorsports.  Headquartered in my district in Concord, North Carolina, Hendrick  Motorsports is now consistently recognized as one of the sport's  premier operations. 

  As an owner, Rick Hendrick has won a total of 14 NASCAR national  series championships, the most all-time. Drivers for Hendrick  Motorsports have become household names including the likes of Jeff  Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, Terry Labonte, Kasey Kahne, and Dale Earnhardt  Jr. In total, Hendrick Motorsports has delivered an incredible 242  total wins. You would be hard pressed to find anyone more deserving of  this honor. 

  This year's class was selected by a comprehensive voting panel that  included track owners, retired competitors, industry leaders, members  of the media, and a nationwide fan vote. In total, a group of five was  chosen to join the ranks of other NASCAR legends in the Hall of Fame.

  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, once again, our country has  been shocked by a horrific act of gun violence, and, once again, the  only real response from Congress has been a moment of silence. 

  Well, this is not the time to be silent. Congress needs to act, and  Congress needs to act now. 

  This murderer at the Pulse nightclub of Orlando, who was once on the  terror watch list, was free to walk into a store and purchase an  assault weapon that could kill 49 people and wound 53 others. Today,  someone inspired by ISIS, who was deemed too dangerous to even board a  plane, could walk into a gun store to buy whatever weapon they want.  That is outrageous. That is why we must pass the no fly, no buy  legislation that would keep those on the terrorist watch list from  buying lethal weapons. 

  Unless we act to finally keep the most dangerous weapons out of the  most dangerous hands, our moments of silence will become our legacy of  silence.

  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the California  State University, Bakersfield (CSUB) men's basketball team and its  unprecedented success in the 2015-2016 season. I commend the hard work  of the Roadrunners and strong leadership of Head Coach Rod Barnes,  Assistant Coaches Jeff Conarroe, James Alford, and Mark Hsu, and  Director of Basketball Operations JD Pollock. The Roadrunner men's  basketball team has represented our community well, and brought  national attention to Bakersfield through dedication that was always  reflected in their games. I am honored--as an alumnus myself--to be  able to add my voice to the chorus of praise, and to congratulate their  season of accomplishment.    On March 18, 2016, the Roadrunners clashed against the number two  seed in Oklahoma, on day one of the 2016 National Collegiate Athletic  Association (NCAA) Basketball Tournament. I witnessed firsthand the  perseverance and grit they became famous for throughout the season. The  Roadrunners fiercely fought to match basket-for-basket against their  heavily-favored opponents, even snatching the lead midway through the  second half, but were ultimately outscored in the final few minutes.    As the Roadrunners celebrate their historic 24 victories in the  Western Athletic Conference, and their first appearance in the NCAA  Division I Tournament, I want to acknowledge the remarkable  determination and incredible teamwork of Aly Ahmed, Jaylin Airington,  Bray Barnes, Dedrick Basile, Damiyne Durham, Kyle Ferreira, Darryl  Geyen, Justin Hollins, Kevin Mays, PJ Posey, Justin Pride, Matt Smith,  and Brent Wrapp. A remarkable winning percentage of .727 reflects upon  the immense amount of hard work they demonstrated throughout the  entirety of the season.    The CSUB men's basketball team exemplifies our community's  commitment to hard work, perseverance, and teamwork. The Roadrunners  should be proud of their achievements this season, and I know that the  community of Bakersfield joins me in congratulating them on their  athletic accomplishments. My fellow Roadrunner alumni and our community  look forward to watching their continued success in the seasons to  follow.

  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Domenika Lynch  for her ten years of service as the executive director of the  University of Southern California's (USC) Latino Alumni Association  (LAA), and also to congratulate her on becoming the next president and  CEO of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI) in  Washington, DC. 

  Ms. Lynch has dedicated years of her personal and professional life  to serving Latinos and the greater Los Angeles community. In addition  to her work for the LAA, Domenika has been a part of the USC  Neighborhood Outreach Grants Committee, has been named a Los Angeles  Community Hero by Telemundo, has received an Educational Leadership  Award from Saber es Poder, and has served on a variety of scholarship  and advocacy boards. 

  A Trojan alumna herself, Domenika has been a thoughtful and  successful leader of one of the strongest Latino alumni associations in  the country. During her time guiding the LAA, it has continued to  invest in student scholarship and mentorship support, while effectively  engaging alumni, building campus and community partnerships, and  securing philanthropic support. 

  Under her tenure, the LAA, its Board of Directors, its Corporate  Advisory Council, and its alumni volunteers have raised over $15  million towards scholarships and other key university initiatives.  Today, the LAA is stronger than ever. Its endowment has more than  tripled, and its donor base is growing. This type of engagement creates  an environment for students to thrive, and encourages these students to  remain committed to their USC community long after they have left  campus. 

  I am confident that Ms. Lynch will be equally successful in leading  CHCI, which has been a trailblazer in developing the next generation of  Latino leaders in our nation's capital. As our country writes another  chapter in its history, Domenika's guidance will ensure that CHCI  continues to increase opportunities for young Latinos, and keeps  encouraging greater diversity and equity in the ranks of America's  future leaders. 

  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Domenika Lynch for her  outstanding record of leadership and service, and in wishing her the  very best as she begins the newest chapter of her career.

  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  passing of one of Monroe County's most respected and decent public  servants. Richard ``Dick'' Ramsay, a former Marathon mayor and city  councilman, small-business owner and airline pilot, passed away on June  2 at the age of 74. 

  A true visionary who worked tirelessly to better his community, Mayor  Ramsay played a pivotal role in the incorporation of Marathon, Florida.  He possessed a genuine passion for the Florida Keys, a passion that was  reflected in his dedication to public service. 

  Dick's contributions to Marathon are both significant and extensive.  He served three 2-year terms on the city council and expressed great  interest in issues concerning the Florida Keys Marathon International  Airport. One of his many successful projects was the newly installed  U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility, which now allows  international flights to clear customs in Marathon for the first time  in decades. 

  Beloved by his family, his friends, and his community, Dick Ramsay  will be dearly missed by all. I am honored to have been able to call  him my friend. My thoughts and prayers go out to the Ramsay family and  to the Florida Keys for the loss of such an active and caring member of  the community.                            Recognizing Ed Knight

  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Edward  B. Knight of the Florida Keys. Ed, as he is known, is a true staple in  our community. During his time in Key West, he and his wife opened one  of the first U.S. Volkswagen dealerships, operated a successful real  estate company, and served as an executive on several boards, including  the Rotary Club of Key West and the Boy Scouts of America. Mr. Knight  also created an annual Rotary scholarship program to help students  attend Florida Keys Community College. 

  Edward Knight is a leader, a businessman, and the definition of a  philanthropist, so much so that Key West Mayor Craig Cates led a naming  ceremony of the White Street Pier in Mr. Knight's honor on June 9. 

  I want to personally congratulate Ed Knight. Thank you for all you  have done for the Florida Keys community throughout the years. Your  service is deeply appreciated.                     Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month

  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize June as  Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month. 

  There are more than 5 million Americans in the United States who have  been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It is a devastating disease for  patients and their families and is currently the sixth leading cause of  death for individuals living in the United States. 

  This disease, unfortunately, cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed,  but as lawmakers, we have the ability to support patients and their  families. I have cosponsored the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act, which would  amend Medicare to cover comprehensive Alzheimer's disease care-planning  services. 

  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to help move toward finding a cure for this awful disease.

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember my  friend, the late racing legend, Benny Parsons upon his induction into  the eighth class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. 

  While he was born in Ellerbe, North Carolina, Benny Parsons grew up  in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains of Wilkes County. After high  school he moved to Detroit, Michigan to work for his father's taxi  company. After being invited to a local race track by a customer, fate  intervened when he was asked to be the driver for the race that night.  In that moment a racing legend was born. 

  In 1970, Mr. Parsons joined the NASCAR circuit full time as a driver  and it wasn't long until he won his first championship. A humble  victor, he was described by many as an ``everyman champion.'' In his  career as a driver he amassed 21 victories and managed to finish in the  top ten 283 times, roughly 54 percent of his races. Following his  driving career, he seamlessly transitioned to television as a very  popular announcer until his death in 2007. I got to know Benny while  serving on a YMCA board that he chaired in Concord, NC. I will always  remember his integrity, humble nature and infectious humor. While he is  sorely missed by the racing community, his legacy will now live on as a  member of the Hall of Fame. 

  This year's class was selected by a comprehensive voting panel that  included track owners, retired competitors, industry leaders, members  of the media, and a nationwide fan vote. In total, a group of five was  chosen to join the ranks of other NASCAR legends in the Hall of Fame.  Mr. Parsons is extremely deserving of this honor and will now be  enshrined forever for his contributions to the sport. 

  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring Benny Parsons, a 2017  inductee of the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise to continue setting the record  straight for the ongoing issue of water rights between Alabama,  Florida, Georgia, and the Army Corps of Engineers. 

  As I said yesterday, language from the committee report that  accompanies this CJS--Commerce-Justice-Science--bill has been inserted  in an attempt to strong-arm the outcome of a matter that should clearly  be left to the States. This is an interstate dispute, with negotiations  and litigation still pending, and much like other parts of the country,  the States have been in negotiations for many years. 

  Clearly, this is not a matter for Congress. This is not a matter that  Congress in any way needs to insert itself into. Furthermore, this is a  debate we have already had. 

  Last year, the leaders of both Chambers here in Washington determined  that Congress has no business using the appropriations process to tip  the scales one way or the other on this water rights issue. Why are we  going through this again? 

  This is not the work our constituents had in mind for us when they  sent us here. They expect us to deliver results on the priority issues  of our day, and they expect the national interests and the Constitution  to come before the self-interests of a select few Members of the  Senate, but, yet again, the senior Senator from Alabama is attempting  to impose Washington as the solution for a matter that should be and is  being handled by the States. 

  For over 20 years, Alabama, Florida, and Georgia have litigated and  negotiated over water rights issues. Despite decades of litigation,  neither Alabama  nor Florida has been able to prove any real or substantial harm  resulting from the Army Corps of Engineers' or Georgia's water  management practices. As a matter of fact, they are under court  direction today. 

  The numbers show this. Since 1980, the population of the Metro  Atlanta water district has more than doubled from just over 2 million  to over 5 million, and that is as a percentage of about 10.5 million  people in the State as a whole in 2014. Since 2000 alone, the  population of this metro area has grown by more than 1 million. 

  Since the formation of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning  District in 2001, water withdrawals in Metro Atlanta have decreased  dramatically even as the population grew by more than 1 million. As a  matter of fact, the consumption per capita has gone down by more than  one-third. 

  This is good water management. Georgia has been a good steward of  water resources, and this has been repeatedly validated. In fact, Metro  Atlanta water systems have gone above and beyond the necessary water  management practices to ensure that they are conserving as much as  possible and efficiently properly using the water they do withdraw. 

  Again, the numbers back this up. There are 15 counties in the metro  district. As I said before, from 2000 to 2013, water withdrawals have  declined by more than one-third. Both Alabama and Florida have  consistently lost in court because their claims have been found to be  baseless. Because they cannot win in court, now we see the senior  Senator from Alabama trying to win through the appropriations process  in Congress. 

  There is a case on this issue currently being litigated between the  States in the U.S. Supreme Court that is due to be heard by a court- appointed special master in November of this year. There is another  case pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia,  and yet another one is pending in the U.S. District Court for the  Northern District of Georgia. We need to allow the legal process to run  its natural course on these cases. 

  But, again, some in this body are short-circuiting that litigation  through the appropriations process. That is just not appropriate. This  short-circuiting would have improper influence on the outcomes of these  court cases. That speaks volumes. 

  We are not sent here to pick winners and losers among the States.  This is a matter for the States involved to litigate and negotiate, as  are all interstate disputes. By the way, this could set a dangerous  precedent not just for these three States but for all States that have  water rights issues. 

  This is a matter for the States involved to litigate and negotiate,  as are all interstate disputes. This is not a matter to be dealt with  through the appropriations process of the Federal Government. 

  Attempts at this kind of Washington meddling are exactly why many of  our constituents have lost trust in this body. We must remove this  language from the CJS bill or we will set a dangerous precedent moving  forward. 

  I yield back the remainder of my time.
