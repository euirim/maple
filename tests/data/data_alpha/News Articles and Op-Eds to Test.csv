944175,National Review Online - It's Time to Rebuild the Tax Code,9,"By Orrin Hatch

Everyone agrees that the American tax system is broken and in need of reform. It stifles job creation, innovation, and competitiveness. It's counterproductive, confusing, and a serious drag on the economy. Simply put: Tax reform is no longer an option but an obligation.

With the start of the new Congress, Washington has an opportunity to rebuild the tax code in a way that will spur economic growth, jump-start job creation, and once again restore prosperity to the American people.

To achieve this goal, however, the White House must get in the game and start to lead. This means putting smart policy ahead of poll-tested talking points and working with Congress in good faith. It also means accepting principles established by Congress to lay the foundation for true reform.
The most important principles were those followed by President Reagan nearly 30 years ago when Congress last acted to overhaul the tax code: economic growth, fairness, and simplicity. 

Tax reform should promote growth in the economy and reduce economic distortions. It must eliminate the uncompetitive nature of the code and reduce disincentives to work, entrepreneurship, savings, and investment.

Tax reform should reduce tax expenditures to broaden the tax base and simultaneously lower tax rates. A broader base coupled with significantly lower tax rates is the foundation of what would be a much fairer tax system. 

We also need a simpler system. Tax reform should reduce complexities in the tax code to lower compliance burdens, increase efficiency, and free up resources for productive activities, including job creation.

While these three principles will be vital to congressional tax-reform efforts, the demands of a 21st-century global economy will require even more, most notably: permanence, competitiveness, promotion of savings and investment, and revenue neutrality.

In today's world, permanence and competitiveness are key. The code's lack of certainty hurts job creation, stifles planning, and inhibits economic growth. Permanence would make our code reliable and predictable for American households and businesses. 

We need a tax system that no longer threatens to change from year to year, and we need a tax code that is internationally competitive. Tax reform should substantially lower the corporate tax rate and move us to a territorial tax system, with base erosion protections, to ensure that American job creators are on a level playing field with their foreign competitors.

A tax overhaul should also promote savings and investment, which provide fuel for growth. Many aspects of the current U.S. income-tax system discourage savings and investment, which ultimately hurts long-term growth. 

Lastly, tax reform should embrace the principle of revenue neutrality. If we're scouring the tax code looking for ways to squeeze more revenue to fuel government spending, we're not reforming the tax code, we're raising taxes. It's as simple as that. Tax reform should not be used as an excuse to raise taxes on the American people. Any such effort is a needless distraction.

In fact, those who believe that the American people are currently undertaxed should look at historical trends. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal revenues already exceed historical averages and will remain that way for the foreseeable future. Congress should deal with the problem of excessive federal spending, but it shouldn't look to tax reform for even more revenue.&#8232;

These seven principles should serve as the guideposts for any and all tax-reform efforts. Any serious idea should link back and be relevant to at least one of these seven principles. The best ideas should embrace all of them. 

The 114th Congress is set to begin, and I'm hopeful that a path to real bipartisan tax reform will take shape. I plan to help move the conversation forward in the coming weeks and months by engaging with members of both parties and unveiling additional steps.

True success will take more than just talk. It will take hard work, commitment, and, of course, bipartisan compromise. The challenge before us is clear."
944281,CNBC - US-Mexico Economic Talks are Key to Cross-Border Prosperity,9,"By Penny Pritzker

On both sides of the 2,000 mile border we share with Mexico, our people and our businesses are working together to create jobs, economic opportunity, and prosperity. The interests we share with our neighbor to the south, our third largest trading partner in the world, are not just about border security and immigration. We are also focused on how we can grow the $1.5 billion in goods and services that already move between our countries each day, do more business together, and strengthen our collective competitiveness. 

As the United States welcomes Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to Washington this week, the importance of our commercial relationship with Mexico will take center stage during the second meeting of the U.S.-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue (HLED).

Nearly two years ago, President Obama and President Peña Nieto announced the formation of the HLED, a forum through which our governments can better collaborate to advance strategic commercial priorities central to promoting mutual economic growth, job creation, and global competitiveness. As a result of these efforts, we are already working together more effectively. We have made significant strides in areas ranging from cross-border trade to the promotion of a knowledge economy.

The HLED has achieved several concrete outcomes. We are moving goods and people across our border more efficiently, and we have negotiated a new air-services agreement that will benefit travelers, shippers, airlines and the economies of the United States and Mexico with competitive pricing and more convenient services. To reduce bottlenecks at the border, we are expanding capacity at our ports of entry. For example, at the El Chaparral-San Ysidro Port of Entry between San Diego and Tijuana, the busiest land crossing in the world, new construction has reduced wait times from three hours to approximately 30 minutes. We are collaborating to boost travel and tourism between the United States and Mexico, expand supply-chain security, and better manage our telecommunications systems along the border. Our two governments have also pledged to increase international education exchanges, which will help ensure citizens of both countries have a workforce with the skills needed to succeed in the global economy.

The HLED represents the next step forward in the U.S.-Mexico economic relationship, a fruitful partnership shaped by openness, cooperation, and collaboration. Today, two decades after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) entered into force, the benefits of our economic integration are clear. Two-way trade between the U.S. and Mexico now stands at half-a-trillion dollars annually, supporting millions of jobs in both countries. In the manufacturing/assembly sector, 75 percent of company activity is located along the border, and the United States supplies 80 percent of the inputs. When the U.S. imports final goods from Mexico, roughly 40 percent of the content of that merchandise has originated in the United States.

At the same time, business investment in both directions has grown dramatically. Nearly 20,000 American firms now have operations in Mexico, and the country is now the 15th largest source of foreign direct investment into the United States, supporting thousands of American jobs in sectors ranging from mining to retail. In short, we trade with each other more than ever. We invest in each other more than ever. We produce together more than ever. And we can do more.

Through the HLED, we are regularly engaged with the government of Mexico to devise solutions that will create new trade and economic opportunities and strengthen our commercial ties. We are doing this all in partnership with civil society and the private sector -- because no one will feel the impacts of the HLED more strongly than U.S. and Mexican businesses and workers.

Guided by input from our stakeholders, our countries will focus on numerous key areas in 2015, including energy, modern borders, workforce development, regulatory cooperation, stakeholder engagement and partnering in regional and global leadership. In February, my team will host a stakeholder event to share the progress we've made on the HLED and solicit input from the private sector and civil society.

When I chose Mexico as my first international trade mission as Secretary of Commerce, I did so knowing the relationships between our governments, our businesses, and our people have never been stronger. As we look to the future, it is clear that the United States and Mexico are poised for even greater success as a result of our deep and blossoming cultural, economic, and person-to-person ties. Using the HLED as our guide, we can increase exports and boost trade, promote economic growth, create good jobs for all of our citizens, and keep our nations open for one another's business."
944728,Washington Post - Jacob Lew: Let's Leave Wall Street's Risky Practices in the Past,9,"By Jacob J. Lew

We enter 2015 in the United States with a strong and growing economic recovery. Over the course of that recovery, the private sector has created 11.2 million jobs. The federal deficit has gone from 9.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to 2.8 percent in 2014. Our stock market closed 2014 at a historic high. Six years after the financial crisis, the U.S. economy is driving the global economy once again. This recovery is not an accident but rather the result of the determination of the American people, the resilience of our businesses and policy choices made by President Obama.

We have also been working to make this growth more sustainable, including by implementing the crucial financial reforms the president fought for and signed into law after the crisis. It has been five years since the administration worked with Congress to pass the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as Dodd-Frank. These reforms have made our financial system safer and more resilient, and consumers, investors and taxpayers are now protected from the types of abuses that helped cause the crisis.

Given how far we have come, and the scars that still linger, it is hard to understand the efforts of some to undermine our ability to protect consumers and taxpayers from excessive risks taken by financial institutions. Taxpayers should never again have to step in to prevent business failures; that is why the Wall Street Reform Act ended ""too big to fail"" as a matter of law. The reforms also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog designed to protect consumers of financial products from unfair, abusive and deceptive practices. One of the critical lessons of the financial crisis was that no agency was responsible for monitoring risks across the entire financial system, including the less-regulated parts of the system. This is why the Wall Street Reform Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council -- to watch over the entire financial system and bring together all major financial regulators to make sure they do not operate in silos and possibly miss the worst threats to financial stability.

Opponents who are fighting to repeal these reforms, or impede implementation, make no secret that they are gearing up for a multifront assault to weaken effective oversight of Wall Street and protections for Main Street. Their focus -- which includes weakening the newly created and already effective consumer watchdog agency, eroding transparency in the derivatives markets and underfunding the regulators in charge of enforcement and oversight -- amounts to an agenda that would take us back to the dangerous conditions that existed before the financial crisis.

Just this week, we saw a bill debated and appropriately defeated on the House floor that would have reduced investor protections and undermined the Wall Street Reform Act in several ways, including by needlessly delaying implementation of the Volcker Rule, which limits speculative trading by banks. We are also prepared to oppose more disguised attacks on financial reform, such as bills that would make it easier for opponents of Wall Street reform to use the courts to stymie the regulatory process when their efforts are unsuccessful in Congress.

There are, however, a number of important issues that we can work on together with Congress. Throughout our history, divided government -- and the give-and-take it demands -- has been a catalyst for forging lasting, bipartisan solutions to some of our nation's biggest problems. The arrival of a new Congress in Washington this week provides a fresh opportunity for congressional leaders and the administration to find common ground to get things done, and it is clear there are areas where we can make progress in the weeks and months ahead.

Most Americans and a bipartisan majority of Congress can agree that we need to rebuild our nation's roads and bridges, unlock trade agreements so U.S. businesses can reach new markets and create jobs, and reform our business tax system to eliminate unfair and inefficient loopholes and create a tax code that is more fair, simple and competitive. Equally important, Americans have a right to expect that their representatives will not put our economy in the kind of jeopardy that caused the worst financial crisis and recession of our lifetime only six years ago.

The president has made clear that he is prepared to defend the gains we have made against attempts to water down protections and expose the economy to the risky practices of the past. Too often, lobbyists and special interests have persuaded Congress to deregulate our financial system at moments of economic calm, but we must not weaken the tools we need to protect consumers and taxpayers from excessive risks taken by financial firms. We have come a long way since the financial crisis, but it would be a grave mistake to forget recent history and the importance of effective oversight and enforcement.

With the New Year and a new Congress, let us maintain our resolve to protect consumers, investors and taxpayers, and let us work together in areas where bipartisan consensus can help the American people. By doing so, we will help to continue to propel the economic recovery and secure our economic future."
944945,Reuters - Congressional Proposal Offers Internet Rules of the Road,9,"By John Thune and Fred Upton

For the past decade, a debate has raged in Washington and across the country about the best way to protect an open, unfettered Internet. The increasing use of smartphones and web-connected products and services make finding the right answer more important than ever.

The House of Representatives and the Senate, working together, have come up with a working proposal. We plan to begin a public discussion of it this week.

We need unambiguous rules of the road that protect Internet users and can help spur job creation and economic growth. The rules we propose would prohibit blocking and throttling (the selective slowing of data), and also ensure that Internet service providers could not charge a premium to prioritize content delivery.

The Federal Communications Commission has limited ability to establish the kind of legally sound, pro-innovation rules that consumers and developers need. One ill-fitting tool available is Title II of the Communications Act -- a set of rules conceived in the Franklin D. Roosevelt era for public utilities. Policymakers, however, need updated tools written for the Internet age.

Using Title II could result in billions of dollars in higher government fees and taxes on consumers' monthly broadband bills, according to a Progressive Policy Institute report. It also could extend new regulations to areas like mobile broadband without recognizing the unique challenges that mobile carriers face.

One near-certainty is that this approach will perpetuate years of litigation and even more uncertainty for consumers and job creators.

Seeking a better way forward, we are working with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to establish clear, updated and reasonable rules of the digital road to protect an open Internet.

Our nation's current technology and telecommunications laws were meant for an era of rotary telephones, brick-sized cellular phones and expensive long-distance service. By acting legislatively, we can set aside the baggage and limits of an antiquated legal framework and work with the Federal Communications Commission to ensure the Internet remains the beacon of freedom and connectivity that defines America in the 21st century.

As a legislative body, Congress has far more flexibility than the commission to narrowly tailor rules appropriate for today's digital ecosystem. Congress can establish clear protections for consumers that can make sure innovators are free from gatekeeper interference, without affecting incentives for robust private-sector investment.

By updating our communications laws for today's online world, Congress can ensure the continued growth of our digital economy while preventing harmful government overreach.

In the coming days, we plan to pursue a public process to draft and enact bipartisan legislation that would protect the open Internet. We hope FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and the public will join Congress in working to build and enact a shared set of principles that will protect Internet users, promote innovation, encourage investment -- and withstand legal challenge.

We have made this an early priority of this Congress, demonstrating we can come together on a bipartisan basis to protect the vitality of the Internet -- now so indispensable to our economy and way of life. Enduring, long-term protections for our digital freedoms are something we should all support."
944948,"CNN - Can We Find Cures For 7,000 Diseases?",9,"By Fred Upton and Diana DeGette

Despite the conventional wisdom that Washington is a frozen island of partisanship, a hopeful thaw is underway. For the past year, we have been spearheading a bipartisan effort to update the process of discovering, developing and delivering medical therapies to help people live longer and better lives.

After months of listening to experts and stakeholders, the path to faster cures is clearer than ever. We call it the 21st Century Cures initiative, and Congress is about to take a major leap down this road of hope.

There are over 7,000 diseases yet we only have cures and treatments for 500 of them. This unacceptable fact led to one simple question: What policies can we enact to help get more cures and treatments to patients?

Our review revealed several areas of reform that will close the gap between the science of medicine and the regulations that impact the volume and fate of new therapies. Our legislation will modernize all of these categories, removing outdated hurdles that can prevent innovation from flourishing or from fleeing the United States.

First, we must modernize clinical trials to streamline the approval of drugs and devices. Safety has and always will be a top priority. But the old approach of automatically applying a therapy to a broad group of patients is no longer the best path forward, particularly for those diseases for which we do not have a treatment or cure.

Technologies like genetic screening can help us target the right treatments to the right group of patients, creating opportunities for smaller, more targeted and effective trials. We will also streamline the paperwork associated with conducting scientific investigations, whether it's making it easier to recruit patients for clinical trials or adapting the operation of trials as we learn new information.

Second, we will better integrate the patient perspective into the regulatory process. Building off of the Food and Drug Administration's Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) program, we are looking at ways to help strengthen FDA's efforts to further incorporate the patient's perspective. New public-private partnerships that can help build the science around biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes are one way to produce more collaboration, move toward faster cures and better involve patients. We also will create a predictable process for the qualification of biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes so we can utilize these tools in the development process.

Third, we must promote better access to and sharing of information such as genomic and other clinical data to foster more collaboration among researchers. We will also assist developers and entrepreneurs building innovative, patient-focused technologies by removing regulatory uncertainty as they build apps and other new products. With the explosion of technology, we can collect, monitor and analyze information like never before, helping patients stay healthy and adopt healthy habits while also making treatments safer and more effective. Finally, fostering better interoperability and the collection and secure sharing of data for research are other critical components to modernizing the development of treatments.

Fourth, we will invest in the future of science. Our legislation will help young, emerging scientists with expanded access to resources and will take steps to ensure federal dollars are invested wisely. Many of our most promising investigators -- many with great ideas and cutting edge training -- are hamstrung by the challenges of securing much-needed support. We will encourage them to conduct research here in the United States, creating jobs and ensuring that patients here at home have access to the most innovative, new treatments.

Finally, we will better incentivize new drugs and devices for unmet medical needs. This includes streamlining the premarket process while establishing mechanisms to better capture real world evidence post-market. We can also examine incentives, such as exclusivity or simplifying the reimbursement process, to produce drugs and devices for diseases with unmet needs.

America has a strong history of finding solutions to diseases through medical innovation. Today, partnerships with patients and advocates, health care workers and researchers, and government and the private sector can speed the cycle of finding faster cures.

Given the rate of recent scientific progress, it's time to modernize policy to move the process of discovery, development and delivery even faster. The 21st Century Cures initiative is a bipartisan effort to melt Washington's polarization and do just that."
945023,"Washington Times - Preventing a ""Cyber Pearl Harbor'",9,"By Michael McCaul

It took an attack by a nation-state on Hollywood to bring the threat of cyberattacks to the forefront of the Americans' consciousness, but we have been fighting this war for decades.

Most Americans think of cyberattacks as just threats to their identity and financial information, such as the recent high profile data breaches on Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase. As the Sony attack has proven, though, we have now reached a new era of cyberterrorism where threats cause just as much damage and fear as a bomb threat.

While the economic damage of this hack is disconcerting, the real significance lies in the fact that, according to the FBI, this marks the first major destructive cyberattack waged against a company on U.S. soil.

This attack aimed to destroy the company's computer network -- not just steal information -- much like the 2012 Iranian-backed attack on Saudi Arabia's national oil company, Aramco, which damaged 30,000 computers. A similar attack on our critical infrastructure might collapse our power grid, wreak havoc on airlines or trains, and taint our water supply -- any of which could lead to the loss of lives.

The situation escalated when the hackers threatened 9/11-style terrorist attacks on movie theaters that planned to screen Sony's comedy about North Korea, ""The Interview.""

The FBI and Homeland Security have recently confirmed the attack originated from North Korea. Because there are little to no consequences for conducting cyberattacks, criminals and nation-states are becoming bolder in their threats and behavior. Russia, China, North Korea and Iran are increasingly hacking into U.S. companies and government networks for espionage purposes or financial gain. Gen. Keith Alexander, former director of the National Security Agency, described this loss of intellectual property as ""the greatest transfer of wealth in history.""

We have no effective strategy in place to stop it.

Over the past two years, I have worked to enact legislation to address the challenges that threaten our nation's critical digital networks. Last Congress, I shepherded five cyber bills through Congress that were enacted into law, which lay out the rules of the road on how cyber information will be shared between government and the private sector. They establish a federal civilian interface at the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate cybersecurity across the 16 critical infrastructure sectors and the private sector, bolster Homeland Security's cyber workforce, improve the department's ability to secure federal networks, and expand cybersecurity research and development efforts.

While these pieces of cybersecurity legislation are a huge step forward in protecting our nation and critical infrastructure from cyberthreats, there is still much more work to be done. The assistant director of the FBI's cyber division, Joseph Demarest, told Congress the sophisticated malware used in the Sony hack ""would have slipped and gotten past 90 percent of the net defenses that are out there today in private industry and been a challenge to state governments."" It is going to take greater collaboration between the federal government and the private sector to tackle this growing 21st century threat.

In order to have greater visibility of the larger cyberthreat landscape, we must remove the government bureaucratic stovepipes that inhibit our abilities to effectively defend America, while ensuring citizens' privacy and civil liberties are also protected. The private sector must be able to share cyberthreat information with DHS' civilian interface, the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC). To do this, we must remove legal barriers preventing private entities from sharing information with the government, and increase voluntary sharing of cyberthreat information with the center and across all critical infrastructure sectors.

Furthermore, Congress must do more to incentivize private entities to invest in greater cybersecurity practices and procedures. One such incentive would be to clarify that companies could have their cyberdefenses certified as sufficient under the Safety Act, which would provide important legal liability protections in the case of a large-scale cyberattack.

Lastly, good work is currently being done to develop voluntary best practices and procedures to reduce risks to critical U.S. infrastructure. We must ensure this public-private collaboration continues as we push to ensure the cybersecurity of our vital networks.

Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said it would take a ""cyber Pearl Harbor"" to wake the nation up to the seriousness of the cyberthreat. It may have taken an attack on Hollywood to showcase our vulnerabilities and that cyberterrorism is real. The attack on Sony should serve as a warning siren.

To prevent a crippling attack on our nation's critical networks, U.S companies and the federal government must work together to combat those who wish to do us harm. As the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, I will lead a renewed effort this year with my partners in the House and Senate to build on the progress my committee made last Congress by removing the legal barriers for the private sector to share cyberthreat information. Only then will we be able to best prevent, detect and response to the growing cyberthreats today."
945141,"Politico - No, the GOP Is Not at War With Science",9,"By Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Lamar Smith

Since our founding, America's economic strength and national security have depended on scientists and innovators to promote growth and prosperity. Both public and private investments in research and development fuel the economy, create jobs and lead to new technologies that benefit Americans' daily lives.

But to remain a world leader, the United States must ensure that our investments are funding not just any science but the best science.

Our national debt is more than $18 trillion, and the American taxpayer is hurting. If we, as a country, have decided to spend taxpayers' hard-earned dollars on funding science and research, then we need to spend wisely. Every dollar spent by the federal government must be spent just as the typical family deals with spending decisions on car payments, child care, food purchases and housing needs.

So how do U.S. research agencies decide what types of research are deserving of limited federal funds? And how do we assure hardworking American families that their tax dollars are being spent only on the highest priority research that is in the national interest? Unfortunately, in recent years, the federal government has awarded taxpayer dollars toward research that few Americans would consider to be in the national interest.

For example, it is Congress' constitutional responsibility to ask questions when the National Science Foundation decides to spend public funds on a climate change-themed musical ($700,000) or an investigation of tea party activity on social media ($919,000) or to study bicycle designs ($300,000). Other examples of questionable grants funded by the NSF include:

Ancient Icelandic textile industry: $487,049

Eco consequences of early human-set fires in New Zealand: $339,958

History of Chiapas, Mexico (350 B.C.-A.D. 1350): $280,558

Mayan architecture and the salt industry: $233,141

Do Turkish women wear veils because they are fashionable?: $199,088

How local Asian Indian politicians can improve their performance: $425,000

Lawsuits in Peru from 1600-1700: $50,000

Similarly, the National Institutes of Health has engaged in the funding of wasteful projects like $258,000 on a website for the first lady's White House garden.

These programs might sound merely frivolous, but the problem is that when the NSF or NIH funds projects of these kinds, there is less money to support good scientific research that can yield technological breakthroughs and opportunities for economic growth. Ebola-related scientific research is something that Americans want to prioritize, yet this important research is competing with wasteful grants.

Unfortunately, the academic community and the media vilify any attempt by Congress to better understand the grant-award process, labeling it political interference and an attack on science. POLITICO recently published an article describing Republicans' questioning of how agencies such as the NSF and NIH prioritize research spending as the ""next battle in the war on science."" But scrutinizing science funding isn't the same as attacking science.

There's a reason Congress demands answers and accountability from our federal science agencies: to make our nation's scientific research enterprise stronger and more helpful to our nation. The academic community forgets that federal science funding should be in the national interest. Scientific breakthroughs can cure diseases, create millions of jobs and transform society. Interdisciplinary research to understand how the brain works could lead to cures for dementia and Parkinson's disease, as well as advances in treating traumatic injury and combat wounds. Research to advance development of quantum computers could lead to the next generation of fast computers.

The first step toward eliminating wasteful spending should be increased transparency. At the moment, the only information available to the public about grants is a brief summary on the agency's website written by the researcher. Instead, agencies -- not researchers -- should provide a plain-English, nontechnical explanation of why taxpayer-funded grants are important or have the potential to benefit the national interest. Once the process is more open and transparent, it will be easier to redirect public research investments to the areas that boost economic growth and job creation: biology, computer science, mathematics and engineering.

Congress has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and are focused on national priorities. In the new Congress, Republicans, the party of limited government, should propose legislation to eliminate the funding of wasteful projects--and focus on smart investments instead."
945210,"A Pro-Jobs, Pro-Growth Agenda for 2015",9,"On Tuesday, January 6, I was honored to be sworn into the 114th Congress to represent Florida's 17th district. As I raised my right hand and took the oath of office, I was humbled by the sacred trust you placed in me to serve you for the next two years. I remain resolved to serve my constituents and my country to the best of my ability, and to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.

I was proud to have my three sons -- Tommy, Sean and Seamus -- by my side as I swore that oath. They reminded me why I first ran for Congress six years ago -- to make our country safer, freer, and more prosperous for our children.

When I first came to Congress in 2009, Democrats controlled the House, Senate and White House. They rammed through the failed stimulus, the misguided and job-killing Dodd-Frank law, and of course, Obamacare. Our deficits and debt exploded.

Then Republicans took the House, but Harry Reid turned the Senate into a graveyard for many good bills and ideas -- including dozens of bipartisan jobs bills. Yet in the last two years, despite fierce opposition from Reid and Obama, we forced significant spending cuts. We brought spending to the lowest levels in a decade. We rolled back parts of Obamacare and Dodd-Frank. We fought corruption at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), cut the budget from an out-of-control Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and forced an overhaul of a broken Veterans Affairs (VA) medical system. We passed a Farm Bill that saved taxpayer money, eliminated and consolidated more than 100 programs, instituted critical reforms, and included $125 million I requested to help battle citrus disease in Florida.

Now, Republicans control the House and Senate. We have a chance to send the President bills that will help grow the economy and create an environment where small businesses can expand and hire new workers. This will include many bills that passed in the House last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, but never made it past Harry Reid's desk. Now, they'll receive votes in the Senate, and it will be up to President Obama to sign them or veto them -- and the jobs they'll help create.

For example, in our first week of the new Congress, the House sent the Senate three bipartisan bills to help small businesses and create jobs right away:
*    First, the Hire More Heroes Act, which gives small businesses relief from costly Obamacare regulations if they hire more American veterans.
*    Second, the Save American Workers Act, which will restore workers' hours and wages that were cut due to Obamacare.
*    Third, legislation to begin construction on the Keystone Pipeline, which will create thousands of jobs and expand North American energy production.

Over the next year, we will keep our promise to focus on the American people's priorities. We will find common ground to help grow the economy and create jobs. We'll work to fix our broken tax code and tackle the long-term drivers of our national debt. We'll keep taxes low and work to reduce spending and the size of government. We'll fight to secure our borders, oppose amnesty, and demand that the President follow the rule of law. We'll continue the battle to repeal Obamacare and replace it real reforms that will actually reduce costs and give Americans affordable options. And we'll stand up for the right to life.

As a member of the House Intelligence and Appropriations Committees, I will continue my work on behalf of Florida's heartland. I will work to keep our nation safe from the threat of global terrorism, ensure Florida's veterans get the care and services they need, help our citrus growers combat greening disease, block overregulation so that our farmers and ranchers can provide a safe and affordable food supply, and protect your second amendment rights.

Our nation faces grave challenges, but I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance common-sense solutions to grow our economy, encourage job creation, strengthen America's national security, and tackle our national debt.
As we work to achieve these goals, I value your opinions. Please continue to share your ideas with me by emailing through my website, www.Rooney.house.gov; posting on my facebook page, www.facebook.com/reptomrooney; or calling my office at (941) 575-9101.

Thank you again for placing your trust in me for the next two years. It's an honor to represent you."
945479,"USA Today - Sens. Alexander, Blunt & Sasse: Smart Aid for Collegians",9,"By Roy Blunt, Lamar Alexander & Ben Sasse

President Obama was in the right church but the wrong pew when he proposed providing free community college tuition for some students.

The president was right to celebrate the Tennessee Promise to make two years at community colleges or technical institutes tuition free for graduating high school seniors. Using the presidential bully pulpit in this way will cause other states to ask, ""If Tennessee can do it, what can we do to make higher education or workforce preparation work better in our state?""

Obama was also right to support legislation simplifying the absurd 108-question federal student aid application form. Its complexity discourages up to 2 million students from applying for federal aid, according to testimony before the U.S. Senate's education committee.

The president was wrong to try to turn one state's good idea into a huge new federal program. This would put the federal government in charge of regulating the 13th and 14th grades of U.S. education. It would deny students the option to use this new federal aid at private 2-year or 4-year institutions or 4-year public universities, a choice that has been available since 1944 when Congress passed the first federal college access program -- the GI Bill. It would spend as much as $60 billion in federal dollars mostly to help students whose income is not low enough to qualify for existing federal aid.

All three of us were university presidents before we became U.S. senators. We have seen firsthand how the generous system of federal student aid works. More than half of America's 20 million college students have a federal grant or loan to help pay for college. Taxpayers loan $100 billion a year at low rates to students without asking for a credit check and with generous repayment terms.

In addition, taxpayers give $33 billion annually to 9.2 million students in federal Pell Grants of up to $5,730. One third of these Pell Grants are used at community colleges -- where 37% of students have a Pell Grant and the average annual tuition is $3,300. In 16 states -- including California, Texas and Florida -- the average Pell Grant received by a community college student covers the entire tuition bill.

The president's program would use federal dollars to make community college free for students who either didn't qualify for Pell because their household income was too high, or because Pell didn't cover the entire cost of their education. Instead of creating an expensive new federal program that misses the mark, the president and Congress should enact bipartisan legislation introduced this month by six senators that would:

    Reduce the Free Application for Financial Student Aid (FAFSA) form from 108-questions to just two questions: 1) What is your family size? And, 2) What was your household income two years ago?

    Allow high school juniors to learn how much in federal aid they are eligible for as they start to look at colleges.

    Streamline the federal grant and loan programs by combining two federal grant programs into one Pell Grant program and reducing the six different federal loan programs into three.

    Restore year-round Pell Grant availability and provide flexibility so students can study at their own pace. 

    Discourage over-borrowing.

    Simplify repayment options.

Community colleges are the best buy and the most nimble part of higher education. If you want to change those two things, the surest way to do that is a new federal program that misses the mark. Instead, we recommend letting other states do for themselves what Tennessee has done if it fits their circumstances. The right way for the federal government to help is pay for new Pell Grants that will be applied for and awarded if other states emulate ""Tennessee Promise"" and if Congress reduces paperwork and allows students to use Pell Grants year-round."
945492,Fox News - ObamaCare Opt-Out Act: Let All Americans Make Their Own Health Care Decisions,9,"By Sen. John McCain, Sen. John Barrasso M.D.

In the coming weeks, Americans will embark on the painful process of filing their tax returns. While this annual ritual leaves most people confused, depressed and overwhelmed, many will be faced with the additional step this year of paying hundreds or thousands of dollars if they chose not to purchase health insurance under ObamaCare for 2014.

Under the individual mandate required by the president's new health care law, Americans for the first time must pay the higher of two penalties if they are uninsured and did not enroll in ObamaCare last year--either $95 per adult and $47.50 per child under 18, or 1 percent of their yearly household income above the $10,000 tax filing threshold. That means an individual earning $50,000 will face a penalty of $400 this year, and fines could reach up to $2,448 per person or up to $12,240 for a family of five.

Unfortunately, these penalty rates will only continue to climb. Next year, penalties will more than double for those who do not enroll in ObamaCare in 2015, costing the same individual earning $50,000 per year a whopping $800, and families up to tens of thousands of dollars.

No American should be forced into the president's one-size-fits-all health care mandate. Health care should be based on the fundamental principle of freedom, and Americans should be able to have the ability to make their own health care decisions without fear that the government will extract onerous penalties from them.

That is why we reintroduced The ObamaCare Opt-Out Act of 2014 in the Senate last week, important legislation that will allow Americans to opt-out of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage required by ObamaCare. This bill would allow individuals to either notify their state or the federal health care exchange, or use their tax filing to opt-out of ObamaCare and avoid the penalty.  According to the tax-services provider H&R Block, this would impact about 4 million uninsured Americans in 2015.

After four years of ObamaCare, hardworking Americans continue to see their health care costs rise while their coverage choices diminish. It is far past time for American families to once again have the freedom to make their own decisions about what is best for their families.

As the 114th Congress gets underway, we will continue to make this bill a priority and work to restore Americans' freedom to buy affordable health insurance that works for them because they know what's best for their families, not the Obama administration.

945551,Orange County Register - Support Global Fight for a Free Internet,9,"Soheil Arabi will soon have a rope around his neck. The 30-year-old father is languishing on Iran's death row. Yet Mr. Arabi did not kill anyone. He did not rape or steal. The ""crime"" Mr. Arabi committed was writing several Facebook posts that were deemed religiously offensive.

Mr. Arabi's abhorrent treatment throws harsh light upon one of the defining struggles of his generation. The Internet is the newest arena for one of our oldest fights -- the right to free speech. The world's freedoms are increasingly being given - and denied - online. It is a fight the Obama administration has not fought strongly enough.

While Internet usage has climbed to more than 40 percent of the world's population, global Internet freedom has declined for the fourth year in a row, according to Freedom House's Freedom of the Net 2014 report. Online censorship and monitoring is becoming more aggressive and sophisticated around the globe.

In Russia, Putin's government has gone on the offensive, using the Internet as a weapon against democracy. It has been widely reported that Russia is financing hundreds of ""trolls"" -- fake online personalities who attack social media sites with misleading and false information. While the space for free speech in Russia is shrinking, the number of state-owned ""news"" websites is proliferating. The Kremlin uses these websites to create confusion and discredit authors, leaving readers wondering what is true and what is false.

China's ""Great Firewall"" employs thousands of people to scan the Internet, searching for information for that repressive government to block. China also uses technical methods like bandwidth throttling and keyword filtering to censor the Internet. Online libraries, text messaging applications and cloud computing services are also shut off. Right now, China is blocking information on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

Sadly, even our allies in Europe are threatening Internet freedom. Europe's highest court issued a ruling last year allowing individuals to request that Google remove search results about themselves. Under this ""right to be forgotten,"" Google has removed roughly 500,000 links. Those removed links include articles about criminal convictions, investigations and botched medical procedures. A European Union group of privacy regulators is now calling on Google to expand its censorship to global sites. This offers a bleak glimpse into Internet freedom in Europe.

Internet freedom is not just an American value; it is a global value. People around the world are fighting for this freedom. In Cuba, where the Castro government restricts Internet access, people resort to downloading articles to thumb drives and sharing them with each other. In Turkey, when the government earlier this year banned YouTube and Twitter, Internet freedom advocates used outdoor graffiti to instruct people how to use virtual personal networks to circumvent government controls.

We must not let oppressive governments win -- we must ensure the continuity of the global Internet. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, which I chair, is fully engaged on this issue. We have held hearings on Internet freedom, championed passage of an Internet freedom resolution and pressed individual countries behind the scenes to stop Internet blocking.

I am concerned that the Obama administration has not prioritized the fight for Internet freedom and Internet governance. I plan to continue pressing the administration to develop a clear strategic plan to reverse the troubling decline in Internet freedom. U.S. efforts through the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development should address the proliferation of repressive laws, reverse regulatory controls of online media and push back on increased demands on the private sector to self-censor.

We are still in the early days of the Internet. It's us up to all of us to ensure that the Internet remains free and open so that future generations may enjoy its social and economic benefits. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, credited with inventing the World Wide Web in 1989, conceived of it as a network of freedom. Let's not allow repressive regimes to use it as a web of oppression."
945742,The Hill - GOP Serves Up Economic Double Whammy,9,"By Sander Levin

House Republicans are bringing up a double whammy on Thursday -- ending health care from their employer or altogether for millions of Americans and hugely increasing the deficit by nearly $46 billion over 10 years. The legislation they've proposed would amend the employer responsibility provisions of the Affordable Care Act to redefine full-time work from 30 hours a week to 40 hours.

The 30-hour threshold in the Affordable Care Act was designed to minimize the likelihood that employers would avoid the law's requirement of health coverage. Increasing the number of hours to 40 would make it significantly easier to shift workers into part-time status by just a slight reduction of hours. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, redefining full-time work as 40 hours would place more than five times as many workers at risk of having their hours cut so that their employers can avoid providing health insurance. Only a small share of today's workforce -- roughly seven percent -- works between 30 and 34 hours a week, putting them most at risk of having their hours cut below the current 30-hour threshold, while approximately 44 percent work 40 hours a week.

This legislation would also add tens of billions of dollars to the deficit. In July 2014, the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation -- federal organizations tasked with providing nonpartisan analyses for Congress -- estimated that changing the definition of full-time to 40 hours would increase the deficit by nearly $46 billion over the next 10 years. Furthermore, these organizations estimated that the legislation would reduce the number of people receiving employment-based coverage by about one million, increase the number of people receiving insurance through public programs like Medicaid by more than 500,000, and increase the number of uninsured by up to 500,000. 

Some conservatives, even those opposed to any employer mandate, are speaking out against the legislation. Yuval Levin, a conservative commentator, wrote in the National Journal that redefining full-time work to 40 hours ""would make for a worse effect on workers and on the economy. So by setting the definition lower, Obamacare's architects were trying to mitigate the damaging effects of the employer mandate some, and by setting it higher Republicans would be worsening those effects.""

This legislation to change the definition of full-time work continues the Republican propaganda campaign that asserts that the Affordable Care Act is bad for the economy, bad for employers, and bad for workers.  But the evidence shows otherwise.  In fact, independent fact checkers have refuted the Republican claim that health reform will ""kill jobs.""  Since enactment of the health law, the United States has added almost 11 million jobs to the private sector. In the past year alone, the number of full-time workers has grown by more than four million, while the number of part-time workers has actually decreased by more than 800,000.

Republicans' answer to taking away health care is to take away American jobs. It's high time that they put the economy and the middle class first."
945789,The Hill - Building the Infrastructure for a Brighter Energy Future,9,"By Kevin McCarthy and Fred Upton

Our nation's infrastructure system is critical to our national security, economy, and quality of life. Yet despite its significance, Washington frequently overlooks the necessity of energy infrastructure.

North America is now the world's leader in energy production--a seismic change considering hysteric warnings of peak oil several years ago. This transformation greatly benefits the American people by bringing lower energy costs and more jobs. But to fully realize our energy renaissance, more is required than just increased oil and gas production.

During and after production, our resources need to be moved to our cities and communities. Right now, the way we do this is outdated--we transport small amounts of oil in tanker trucks over long distances. What's worse, our old and inefficient system has real economic costs.

Just look at what happened last winter in the Northeast. The harsh weather spiked demand for natural gas, but because of pipeline constraints the needed supply could not be delivered. As a result, heating and electricity prices skyrocketed--up to almost double in some states compared to the national average. This winter, customers of the largest utility in Massachusetts could pay $33 more a month on top of the highs of last year.
The deficiency of our energy infrastructure also threatens industries responsible for some of the greatest job growth from pre-recession levels. Creating the infrastructure we need not only protects that job growth, it will also open up new markets for American energy at home and abroad, providing even more opportunity for economic growth.

And in an increasingly hostile world, our renewed energy abundance limits the influence of some of the worst human rights abusers, like Russia. But unfortunately, old laws in America are restricting this progress.

Upgrading our infrastructure is essential, and it has bipartisan support. The president has frequently said that he thinks Congress and the White House can work together on infrastructure. Unfortunately, his recent spree of veto threats says otherwise. But the House will continue to give the president opportunities to make good on his promise to work with Congress.
This week the House will consider the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Act sponsored by Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.). This bill streamlines the permitting process for natural gas pipelines, which are exactly what New Englanders need to enjoy affordable energy. Next week the House will consider a bill to expedite the approval of liquefied natural gas export facilities, letting America use its energy abundance to benefit our allies and counter our adversaries.

Both of these bills--an important opening step to ensuring affordable energy for all Americans--will have support from Democrats and Republicans. If the president puts down his veto pen and joins us, America will have an even brighter energy future.

McCarthy has represented Congressional districts in California's San Joaquin Valley since 2007. Upton has represented Michigan's 6th Congressional District since 1987."
945990,Democrats must bring their message home,9,"After last November's election, Democrats in Congress are at our lowest numbers since President Herbert Hoover. This week's House Democratic Caucus retreat offers us a chance to take a hard look at ourselves to see why. 

Democratic turnout was even lower than many expected in an off year. It's clear that the plans and positions our party was selling weren't compelling enough to get our own core constituencies out of the house to vote. And we failed to convince independents that we are the party they can trust to grow the economy and keep high-quality jobs here at home. 

Polls show that Democrats were right on many issues important to Americans: education, the environment, and equality. And people agree with our message of economic fairness, but polls also show that voters don't trust us to deal with the economy, and they don't see our message as relevant to their futures.  
Despite recent economic good news, too many Americans are working harder than ever before yet still struggling to make ends meet, buy a home, or send their kids to college. Middle-class families are waiting for either party to propose a credible plan to address their lack of wage growth and opportunity. Young voters are skeptical of government in general and in particular see us as focused on the past rather than the future. Most 20-somethings are not concerned about Social Security and Medicare and, even if they are thinking about it at all, doubt that we are fiscally responsible enough make sure it will still be solvent when they do need it.  

Democrats understand that government has and can continue to be a positive force for Americans' well-being. But after the failed health care website, the fumbled Ebola protocols, and the fiasco at the Department of Veterans Affairs, our party in government risks being dismissed as the party of bad government. Going forward, Democrats have to challenge incompetence and waste in government honestly and aggressively. We need to embrace regulatory reforms that achieve high standards, but with minimized disruption to businesses large and small. 

And our policy agenda needs to focus on our economic future through education, tax reform, environmental quality, and rebuilding our infrastructure. In an increasingly brain-powered global economy we need the best and brightest students and workers in the world. We need a simpler, more efficient tax code that incentivizes companies to bring overseas profits home so they can be invested here. We need to be making investments in infrastructure at border crossings and our ports to facilitate trade, and working toward bipartisan, long-term, forward-thinking solutions on the transportation trust fund that put it on the path toward sustainability. 

If Democrats can't earn back the trust of Americans, by demonstrating that we have a plan to make government work and grow the economy, we will continue to lose elections, and we will be powerless to ensure future generations have access to the American Dream."
946026,The Hill - Sanchez: Restore the Pell Grant's Clout,9,"College campuses look a little different than they did when I was an undergraduate. The ""typical"" student -- one between the ages of 18 and 22, living on campus and attending school full time -- is becoming less and less typical. Today's college student probably works full time, might have a child to care for at home and faces a mountain of debt from student loans after graduation. So while college has never been easy, today's college student has much more to worry about than passing final exams.

As a nation that values education, we should give every willing student the opportunity to succeed. Since 1972, the need-based federal Pell Grant has done just that. At the beginning of the program, the grant covered the entire cost of college. Unfortunately, as tuition costs soar and state and community college budgets are slashed, the federal government is shirking its responsibility to help students succeed. The Pell Grant now covers just a third of the cost of a public four-year school. That means today's student is left fighting to make ends meet now while being saddled with debt for the future.

My colleagues and I have continued to put forward bills to restore the strength of the Pell Grant, make college more affordable and reduce student debt. President Obama recently announced an ambitious proposal to make community college free for students in need. But one common-sense fix that Congress can take right now is reinstating the year-round Pell Grant by passing my All-Year ACCESS Act.

Many schools offer accelerated degrees where students can work through summer and winter intersessions in order to finish faster and jump into the job market. That is an increasingly attractive idea and has proven to boost graduation rates by keeping students on track. However, the Pell Grant only covers tuition from the fall to the spring. That means students aiming to graduate in four years or with plans to transfer to a four-year university by accelerating their education through summer or intersession semesters have to take out more loans -- or simply skip the semester entirely. Studies show that students who face a ""gap semester"" are more likely to put a hold on their studies, default on student loans or drop out altogether.

Congress should pass my All-Year ACCESS Act, which would bridge the gap for these students by restoring year-round Pell Grants and allow both part-time and full-time students to receive the grant. Our economy depends on the strength of our workforce -- strength built upon access to education for all, all year round."
946207,Indian Country Today Media Network - Empowering Indian Country in the New Republican Majority,9,"By Senator John Barrasso

It has been eight years since a Republican Majority was elected to lead the United States Senate. No matter which party is in charge, the American people want action and solutions, not dysfunction.

As Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I am committed to a results-driven agenda focusing on enhancing tribal self-determination and self-governance. I think former President Reagan said it best when describing government: ""Government's first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives.""

Perhaps to the surprise of some, Republicans have been active in establishing or enacting landmark tribal policy. President Richard Nixon authored the Special Message to the Congress on Indian Affairs. President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. My predecessors, as Chairmen of the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senators Ben Nighthorse Campbell and John McCain championed trust reform, Indian health care, and the protection of women from domestic violence.

The federal government has not done well in meeting that first duty or its specific responsibilities to Indian country. Tribal members face far too many challenges in so many areas including health care, education, and economic development. Solutions, not the status quo, are needed to address these challenges.

During this Congress, the Committee will hold hearings and meet with tribal leaders on how Congress can help empower tribes. We must reverse government policies that work to the detriment of tribes. Based on this discourse, I intend to develop and introduce legislation aimed at cutting red tape to provide a greater opportunity for economic development in Indian country.

The Committee will hold a series of oversight hearings aimed at identifying the many issues impacting tribal development. Many additional issues are poised for and in need of Committee attention. These include housing, education, irrigation, Indian child protection, and substance abuse prevention.

As a doctor, I understand these issues all too well from the two tribes I represent in my home state of Wyoming, the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone Tribe.

The first bill I introduced as chairman is the Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self Determination Act. It has six cosponsors and I expect many more members will support us. This bipartisan bill will promote more tribal autonomy and decision making in the energy sector. We are committed to giving the power back to the tribes and not the federal government. As the National Congress of American Indians President Brian Cladoosby said recently, this bill will ""create careers and capital in Indian country.""

I look forward to working together in the years ahead as we continue to strengthen our relationship based on both respect and trust. Together, we can improve the lives of Native Americans and make progress in helping tribal families, communities, and businesses succeed."
946286,Roll Call - Releasing the Promise of American Natural Gas | Commentary,9,"By Reps. Bill Johnson and Mike Pompeo

When it comes to transporting our bounty of natural gas -- whether it's to U.S. consumers or our allies across the world -- we have a problem, and that problem is government interference. But the good news is, it's a problem that can be easily solved. We can overcome these obstacles by updating our energy policies to match our new energy realities.
The House has fast-tracked two commonsense solutions to eliminate government roadblocks. The Pipeline Permitting Reform Act, which passed the House last week by a bipartisan vote of 253-169, and the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act, which will be considered this week, seek to hold government agencies accountable and establish reasonable regulatory deadlines.
Now is our chance to get these solutions over the finish line. In America's new Congress, we will work to build the architecture of abundance we need to embrace the tremendous opportunities of American energy. Natural gas holds great promise for our energy future, but only if we cut the red tape from the past. Everyone should be able to get behind thoughtful solutions that say yes to jobs and yes to energy."
946505,Fox News - Obama's Terror Strategy is Failing: US Must Heed Lessons of 9/11,9,"By Marco Rubio

It is increasingly apparent that the U.S. war against Islamic extremism has been put on hold by President Obama and his national security team. 

President Obama failed to even mention Al Qaeda during his State of the Union address. In early January, the recent terrorist attacks in Paris against the Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket gave us a glimpse of what the future of terrorism looks like, and what the civilized world will have to defend against.  

At the same time, the unfolding chaos in Yemen and loss of a U.S. partner in the fight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) raises serious concerns about the future of a country that four months ago President Obama cited as a successful model for U.S.-led efforts to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

ISIL and AQAP are two faces of the same enemy, radical violent Islam, which is on the march around the world.  

In 2013, ISIL was confined to Syria and Iraq. As the Syria civil war dragged on, and in the absence of early, forceful intervention on the part of the United States or European nations, the chaotic situation spread to Iraq, where weak security services were no match for an emboldened terrorist army.  

In 2014, global support to the Islamic State blossomed as it began to supplant likeminded terrorist groups, and the Islamic State counted affiliates in Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia.  ISIL even has begun to make inroads in Yemen, where the United States has been involved in efforts to degrade AQAP's capabilities, but have been unable to eliminate AQAP's ability to conduct attacks on us and our allies.  AQAP remains one of the most pressing security threats America currently faces as the recent attacks in Paris show.

In the wake of the Paris attacks and plots disrupted elsewhere in Europe, European capitals are rightfully defiant in the face of terror. But without a change in our strategy, the task of defending against the triple threat of home grown extremism, jihadists who have easy access to hotbeds of radicalization in places like Yemen and Syria, and the expansion of the Islamic State, will be nearly impossible.

The Islamic State continues to recruit extremists in Europe, the Middle East, and as far away as southeast Asia, using targeted, high quality videos, magazines and literature copied in several languages to spread their message around the world.  They trumpet their successes on the battlefield, and try to portray a welcoming environment centered on family and Islam as a means to attract terrorists and their families as subjects of their caliphate.  

The United States and all civilized countries need to coordinate our efforts to fight the Islamic State first by cutting them off.  We must counter their message on social media; bolster allies like Iraq and Jordan; and ensure that we prevent suspected terrorists from traveling back and forth between their homelands and places like Syria, Libya, and Yemen.  Perhaps most importantly, we have to help governments eliminate the safe havens that the Islamic State relies on to gather strength.  

Syria, Yemen, and Libya are all examples of our failure to learn one of the fundamental lessons of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 -- that failed and failing states breed instability and are potential safe havens for terrorists who will eventually turn their attention toward us.

We also cannot afford to ignore another lesson of 9/11 and curtail intelligence gathering capabilities that have been legally and painstakingly established following those horrific attacks.

 The U.S. government should implore American technology companies to cooperate with authorities so that we can better track terrorist activity and monitor terrorist communications as we face the increasing challenge of homegrown terrorists radicalized by little more than what they see on the Internet.  

This year, a new Republican majority in both houses of Congress will have to extend current authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and I urge my colleagues to consider a permanent extension of the counterterrorism tools our intelligence community relies on to keep the American people safe.

The challenge we face as free societies is unlike anything we have seen in recent decades.  As we look at this moment in the long war against terrorism, it is encouraging to see Europeans aggressively moving to defend the continent following a horrific attack.  But one need look no further than the setbacks in Yemen and the stalemate in Syria and Iraq to see the limitations of President Obama's current strategy.  

Lofty speeches and half measures do not defeat terrorist groups.  They also do not keep Americans safe in the long term.  The threat from Islamic extremism is only growing and without greater leadership from the United States, I fear that it will only be a matter of time before innocent Americans pay the ultimate price if we continue to underestimate our enemies and not develop a strategy that is commensurate to the threat."
946590,Tuscon Sentinel: AZ's Influence Grows With Ag Cmte Appointment,9,"In 1952, Truman was president, the Dodgers still played in Brooklyn, and I was a toddler in the White Mountains of eastern Arizona.

1952 also happens to be the last year that Arizona had any representation on the powerful House Committee on Agriculture. That's why it's good news for Arizona's farmers, ranchers and forestry workers that I was just appointed to the Agriculture Committee in the 114th Congress.

Here's why the Ag Committee's work directly affects Arizona and especially those of us who live in Congressional District One:

Our district has more than 13,500 farms and nearly 23,000 farm operators.

Our district's farms generate products with a market value of nearly $1.2 billion.

Our district has seven national forests, and our communities face ongoing challenges with forest health and wildfire prevention.

The Ag Committee oversees these issues and many others: agricultural economics and education; dairy, livestock, poultry and meat production; nutrition; forestry; water conservation; and rural development.

In this new Congress, I will also continue serving on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which oversees issues such as roads, bridges, railways, pipelines, transportation corridors, water resources and other infrastructure issues.

Because our Arizona district includes large amounts of federally owned land, our rural counties often suffer losses in property taxes due to nontaxable federal land. That's why in this new Congress, I'll continue my push to permanently authorize the Payment-in-Lieu-of-Taxes (PILT) program.

PILT is a critical piece of our county budgets, providing resources to local governments to help rural counties carry out vital services such as firefighting, law enforcement and construction of public schools and roads.

Arizona received $32 million in PILT payments in FY 2013, for example, with more than $13 million going to District One. We must permanently reauthorize PILT so our county governments have the stability they need to plan and budget for each fiscal year.

I've lived my entire life in our district, and I've seen too many boom-and-bust cycles in our local economies. That's why my vision for Arizona is to build a diversified, stable economy.

I'm honored by these committee appointments and eager to work with the Arizona Farm Bureau and fellow Arizonans to solve problems and strengthen our local economies. As the new Congress goes forward, I'll keep fighting for rural Arizona and our way of life."
946858,BuzzFeed - How To Make The President's Visit To India More Than A Public Display Of Affection,9,"When President Obama travels to India next week to be the chief guest at the country's Republic Day celebrations, he'll be the first American president to receive the honor. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation in itself is groundbreaking, because even though the India-U.S. relationship has transformed over the past decade, the legacy of mistrust established during the Cold War and into the early 1990s made it difficult for many Indian politicians to publicly affirm the depth of the partnership.

In some ways, Modi's invite is akin to being invited to meeting your significant other's parents for dinner after several years of courtship. And more importantly for India's role in the world, the invitation is a sign that India's foreign policy is taking a new path, one that doesn't rely on the non-alignment trajectory of the past, but highlights India's vision for the future.

The visit presents an opportunity for the United States to match India's public embrace with some fresh ideas of our own. Trade, defense, and climate and energy will be high on the agenda, as it should be for the two leaders. But I also believe the United States and India must find ways to undo some of the mistrust that remains in order to take this partnership to the next level.

In 1994, when we established the Congressional India Caucus I don't think anyone could have imagined the transformation that has occurred in the U.S.-India relationship. This evolution will be front and center on Monday, when President Obama and Prime Minister Modi will watch the display of Indian military hardware parade down Delhi's Rajpath Boulevard. Though historically the majority of India's arms were supplied by Russia, Washington surpassed Moscow as India's top arms supplier in 2013, with $1.9 billion in sales to New Delhi.

Since 2005, when the U.S. and India signed a 10-year defense framework agreement -- and I hope the agreement's renewal is announced during the visit -- there has been steady progress in the defense relationship. Our governments now engage in regular defense dialogues; India does more military exercises with the United States than with any other country; and by some estimates, India will need to procure upwards of $100 billion in military hardware over the next decade, providing many opportunities for job-creating exports from the U.S.

But in order to advance the partnership, we must move beyond the supplier-purchaser dynamic and support India's desire to establish an indigenous defense capability through the proposed Defense Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI). The DTTI, which focuses on the co-production and co-development of defense technologies, represents a significant shift in U.S. thinking about technology transfers to India. It is my hope that the President's trip can result in an announcement of our first co-production initiative. This will not be easy, but increasing cooperation and interdependence between our militaries will result in a U.S.-India relationship of greater consequence.

And as we look to India to play a larger role globally, we must engage with New Delhi on a variety of regional issues. In Asia, with India's engagement eastward and the U.S. role as a Pacific power, I believe our national security interests naturally align. The U.S. and India should join with the other democracies of the region, including Japan and Australia, and restart the quadrilateral process.

Additionally, an India that is well-integrated into the economic architecture of the Asia Pacific region is good for the United States and the region. We should seek a formal role for India in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. This will not only strengthen APEC by bringing in one of the most dynamic economies in the region, but it would help the Indians become a positive contributor to and a guarantor of APEC's high standards on trade and investment.

Beyond its near neighborhood, we should expand cooperation with India in other parts of the world, including in the Americas, whether it is creating a trilateral dialogue between the United States, India and some of our Pacific Alliance partners, or working with the Organization of American States (where India is an observer state) to ensure that a senior level Indian official is invited to events surrounding the Summit of the Americas which will be held in Panama this April.

When it comes to building trust, it's time the U.S. address the longstanding issue of our aid to Pakistan, who India believes continues to support terrorist groups that attack India. Though India should not have a veto over American foreign assistance programs, I do believe the U.S. can do more to address India's legitimate concern over Pakistan-based terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET) that continue to operate with virtual impunity.

The transformation that is occurring in the U.S.-India relationship has been years in the making. All is not perfect. We will continue to have challenges and find areas where our interests diverge. But thanks to the vision and foresight of Democrats and Republicans in the United States and of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Parties in India, hors d'oeuvres have been served and we have finally been invited to dinner."
947046,Linkedin - A Stronger Middle Class Begins With All of Us,9,"By Penny Pritzker

Today, I traveled to Charlotte for a discussion with the local chamber of commerce about the President's State of the Union address, the state of our economy, and what we can do to support a durable and sustainable American economy.

Last night, President Obama painted a clear picture of where we stand today: that we have turned the page from a period of recession and hardship -- and that our economy is once again on the rise.

The evidence is clear: Over 58 straight months, the private sector has added more than 11 million new jobs. Last year alone, we created 3 million jobs -- the most since the 1990s. Our GDP is up, while our unemployment rate is down. There is no doubt that 2014 was a milestone year for our economy.

We now find our country in a strong position, but we cannot rest on our laurels. Strengthening our economy is a never-ending task, and we must ensure that every American family, worker, and business can reap the benefits of our nation's resurgence.

In Charlotte and as I travel the country in the weeks and months to come, I will be taking every opportunity to highlight the Department of Commerce priorities that support the conditions for economic growth for American businesses and workers.

At the top of our agenda is trade. As the President reminded us last night, pursuing new trade agreements is essential to creating more jobs, strengthening our competitiveness, and spurring our prosperity. We know that 95 percent of the world's consumers live beyond our borders -- and as any business in Charlotte will tell you, that is an opportunity to be seized. With the new trade agreements, we can open new markets to U.S. products, help our businesses reach those customers, and create a fair environment for our companies to compete. If our businesses sell more of our goods and services abroad, they will grow the 11.3 million good-paying jobs here at home that are supported by exports. With the new trade agreements, we can establish the rules of the road on labor, the environment, intellectual property protection and trade in general. With the new trade agreements, we can set high standards for the global trade in the 21st century. And if we don't, other nations will which will leave our businesses and our workers at a competitive disadvantage.

Second, we should act now to implement business tax reform -- a priority that crosses partisan lines -- to lower rates and give American and foreign businesses every reason to keep or locate their operations in our communities. And we should use the one-time revenues generated from repatriation to invest in our infrastructure. Anyone who commutes on our highways or rail lines, travels through our ports and airports, or tries to connect to the Internet in rural and remote areas, knows that our infrastructure is in need of investment.

That's bad for businesses, costly for commuters, and detrimental to our competitiveness. We must reinforce and strengthen our infrastructure to ensure U.S. companies can easily get their goods and services to market, to ensure consumers can get online, and to ensure our country can stay a step ahead of our international competitors.

Finally, we need to invest in our greatest resource: the American people. Nearly every business leader I meet with agrees -- the skills of our workforce must match the needs of our economy in the 21st century. We have already started to act, putting more than $1 billion behind competitive grants for job-driven training models like apprenticeships and partnerships between community colleges and local employers. The President issued a call to action on this challenge, and we must answer it. We must do more to secure a steady pipeline of qualified, well-educated workers to keep our businesses on-track now and in the future.

These ideas are just the beginning. At the Department of Commerce, we will remain laser-focused on everything we can do to strengthen our middle class and our economy at-large -- from expanding travel and tourism, to promoting entrepreneurship and innovative manufacturing, and more. From Day One, President Obama has acted to establish a new foundation for American success; now, with business leaders in Charlotte and across our country, we must work together to keep America open for business."
947149,The Hill - Time for US to Live Up to its Nuclear Potential,9,"Reliable, affordable energy is the foundation of our nation's economy. America is blessed with abundant natural resources. Our energy history is full of new technologies displacing old ones. Coal led the industrial revolution in the United States. Thomas Edison's electric lightbulb displaced candles and kerosene lamps. Following World War II, nuclear science catapulted America to superpower status. 

In 1955, a small town in Idaho became the first in America to be fully powered by an experimental nuclear reactor, the Idaho National Energy Laboratory. Two years later, the first full-scale nuclear power plant began service in Pennsylvania.

But now, 60 years after the ribbon was cut on the first nuclear reactor, the U.S. has not lived up to its potential. Political meddling, costly red tape and a shifting regulatory landscape have jeopardized America's energy security. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the federal government's treatment of safe, reliable and clean nuclear energy.   
In response to a ruling from a federal court, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) last October concluded that Yucca Mountain, located in Nye County, Nev., is a safe long-term repository for storing spent nuclear fuel. This is a welcome announcement, but it came as no surprise to the experts. What's troubling is that a court had to compel the NRC to do its job.    

The NRC acts as the nuclear power industry's regulatory watchdog. With the release of the Safety Evaluation Report, it finally set aside years of fearmongering and declared the project ready to move forward. But the process ground to a halt when the NRC was dragged into a political fight. When Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took over the Senate, he worked tirelessly to undermine the Yucca Mountain project. 

Instead of working toward bipartisan solutions, Sen. Reid put up roadblocks -- from packing the NRC with anti-nuclear activists to eliminating funding for Yucca Mountain. This political obstruction has been a blow to the industry and the rule of law, which requires the federal government to manage the nation's spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain. 

Yucca Mountain would provide safe long-term storage, but more importantly, it would provide certainty for the nuclear energy industry. After $15 billion in spending, the project was halted in its tracks. This was not only illegal but also wasteful. Reid's actions stifled innovation that could have put us on a clear path to greater energy security. Private investment was jeopardized by red tape and endless delays, making it next to impossible to build new nuclear plants within the United States.

As a source of safe, abundant, emission-free power, nuclear energy is a missed opportunity, especially for an administration that claims to support an ""all of the above"" energy policy. And unlike wind or solar energy, nuclear power is reliable -- it works when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining. The regulatory process is cumbersome and lacks the certainty needed for sustained investment in new nuclear energy technology.

Fortunately, creative minds at our national labs and in the private sector are working to unlock the secrets of nuclear science. Advanced reactor concepts offer tremendous advantages. New designs recycle used nuclear fuel, produce heat for industrial applications and yield increased efficiency. In the face of political and regulatory uncertainty, America's entrepreneurs continue to pursue improvements to nuclear technology. 

Last month, the House Science, Space and Technology Committee heard from several experts and entrepreneurs about the great potential of new reactor concepts. One witness discussed how her company is working to develop an innovative molten-salt reactor that will convert what we now consider nuclear ""waste"" into safe, clean electricity. Another company is developing a small modular reactor that has advanced safety features allowing the reactor to self-cool in an emergency without any electricity or mechanized systems.

Nuclear energy has nearly limitless potential. But developing advanced energy technology requires consistent policy, long-term investment and patience. Instead of acting as an obstacle to progress, the federal government should serve as a reliable partner to the scientists, researchers, engineers, inventors and investors working to turn the promise of nuclear energy into reality. Innovative advanced reactor technology provides the opportunity for long-term, high-reward research that will benefit future generations."
947356,"Journal Sentinel - Paul Ryan: We're offering an agenda to empower Americans, restore optimism",9,"I decided not to run for president for a simple reason: Our economy -- our country -- is in jeopardy, and I have an opportunity to do something about it right where I am.

The way I see it, the American idea -- that the condition of your birth doesn't determine the outcome of your life -- is fading. And there's no better place in the House of Representatives to brighten its prospects than at the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bulk of our economic policy.

Our committee just returned from a retreat in rural Virginia, where we holed up for a couple days to develop an agenda for moving America forward. We came up with a set of solutions to spur greater economic growth and increase take-home pay.

But it's more than that. It's an agenda to help restore the optimism essential to the American character. And it offers a stark contrast to the static, government-centered approach the president is still offering after six long years.

As conservatives, we often get too hung up on the numbers and policy details to communicate what we're ultimately fighting for: people -- and their right to live free and chart their own course to prosperity. This agenda allows us to present a positive vision and remind the country of the principles that bind us.

We believe that a healthy economy grows from the bottom up with empowered individuals rather than top down from a heavy-handed federal government. Americans are an aspirational, dynamic people. Our policy should reflect that.

We want comprehensive reform of our tax code because it's perhaps the best thing we can do to spur economic growth, create jobs, and increase take-home pay. But we also want a flatter and simpler system so that individuals, families, and small businesses can live and invest how they choose, rather than letting Washington pull the levers with a complex set of deductions and credits.

We want to repeal and replace Obamacare because the law drives up costs and puts government in between patients and their care. But we also want patient-centered reforms -- with broad-based tax credits and a freer marketplace -- so that patients can pick the plan and doctor they want, with robust competition to drive costs down and quality up.

We want to increase trade and exports because that's a surefire way to create good-paying jobs right here in America. But we also want to break down trade barriers because we know American workers and businesses can compete with any nation. We believe in markets, and there are great big ones abroad in which American farmers and businesses can sell their products and services.

We want to save and strengthen our entitlement programs because government should keep the promises it has made. And we don't have to make our kids pay for our retirement with their future. Security for the elderly and opportunity for the young -- we can have them both.

We want to fix our safety net so that federal programs work for the sick and the poor, without trapping able-bodied Americans in poverty. We believe in the power of upward mobility and know that there are things we can do -- like utilizing the Earned Income Tax Credit -- that can help people move from welfare to work.

Will we get everything we want under this president? Of course not. Much of what we want to do is contradictory to the progressive view of the world.

But we can make progress -- inch by inch or mile by mile. To me, any step toward a freer, more empowered American people is a step worth taking. And if our ideas largely serve as a blueprint of reform for the next president, then we will have set the groundwork for restoring the American Idea.

If we get to work now, we can get this done. We can build a healthy economy and bring back the optimism that this country was built on."
947412,USA TODAY - Drop Subsidies for Politicians,9,"Since 1976, more than $1.5 billion in taxpayer money has been given to politicians to run for office. The underutilized Presidential Election Campaign Fund has subsidized presidential candidates and nominating conventions from its inception.

Four decades later, the presidential fund has fallen into obsolescence, so much that in the 2012 election cycle  nobody chose to participate in the program, yet the parties did take funds for their respective conventions.

Because of President Obama's decision in 2008, no major party candidate has participated in public funding because the funds that major party candidates can utilize are so restrictive.

Supporters argue for the need to modernize the public funding system, but we should examine whether valuable taxpayer dollars are better used on other programs. The fund does not create jobs or stir innovation of any kind, which begs the question: Why should Americans be providing taxpayer subsidies for politicians?

Last April, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act became an example of Congress prioritizing a pediatric research initiative at the National Institutes of Health over taxpayer funding of political conventions. In a time of scarce resources and a need for smaller government, that was not a hard decision.

In the American political system, private contributions have opened up new choices for candidates. In recent memory, it was private money that backed outlier candidates such as Ross Perot in 1992 and Ron Paul in 2008. It is the freedom to raise and spend money freely that has increased the likelihood of viable candidates.

In 1980, 28.7% of taxpayers participated in the presidential check-off fund. That declined to 6% last year.

People are voting with their feet and leaving behind a public funding program they find no value in. It is a mistake to continue to promote wasteful public spending programs for which the taxpayer continually must foot the bill.

Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., co-sponsored a bill to eliminate public funding of presidential campaigns."
947460,The Hill - Spectrum Auction is Bipartisanship in Action,9,"By Tom Wheeler (Chair of the Federal Communications Commission) and Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.)

What if someone told you that Republicans and Democrats in Washington, D.C., worked together to create thousands of new American jobs, reduce the deficit, and contribute billions to our country's economic growth? 

As improbable as that may sound, it happened.

On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission completed an auction of spectrum -- the radio frequencies that transmit the data that fuels our communications and economy -- that will be used to expand and improve mobile broadband. Gross bids totaled almost $44.9 billion, making this auction -- known as the AWS-3 auction -- the highest-grossing spectrum auction in U.S. history.
By any measure, this auction was a resounding success. Winning bids came in about three times higher than analysts had expected, but more important, the revenue generated by the auction will be put to productive and responsible use.

The money will be used to fund FirstNet, the government agency tasked with creating the nation's first interoperable broadband network for first responders, to finance technological upgrades to our 911 emergency systems, and to contribute over $20 billion to deficit reduction.

In addition, the auction brought 65 Megahertz of spectrum to market to fuel our nation's mobile broadband networks. The wireless industry estimates that for every 10 Megahertz of spectrum licensed for wireless broadband, 7,000 American jobs are created and U.S. gross domestic product increases by $1.7 billion. Bringing additional spectrum to market also contributes to technological innovation, greater competition, and more consumer choices.

Not long ago, many people said an auction like this couldn't be done. But both parties in Congress got together in 2012 to pass legislation, which authorized the AWS-3 auction.

The spectrum sold in the auction was originally being used by the U.S. military and other federal agencies before the Act passed. But after the legislation passed, bipartisan congressional and agency staffs worked to develop a plan for how to auction, relocate, and share this valuable federal spectrum without ever jeopardizing critical national security functions at the Pentagon or across the government.

The auction would not have been possible without the collective efforts of a broad range of partners across the government: especially leadership of the congressional commerce committees, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security.

But the success story isn't over yet. Another spectrum boon for consumers and our economy is on the horizon. The law also directs the FCC to hold a first-of-its-kind Incentive Auction: a new, two-sided auction that harnesses market forces to repurpose spectrum voluntarily relinquished by TV broadcasters for wireless broadband. 

This ""beachfront"" spectrum is especially valuable. Since the AWS-3 auction successfully paid for the priorities mandated by Congress, every cent of net revenue from the Incentive Auction -- after payments to broadcasters who elect to relinquish spectrum -- will go toward deficit reduction.

Something like the Incentive Auction has never been tried before -- but neither had anything like the AWS-3 auction. As we've seen, that auction's success is a good sign that bipartisan, collaborative efforts can and do produce positive results for the American people.

We hope to see the same level of dedication, cooperation, and ingenuity as the Commission and its partners work to ensure the Incentive Auction is a success. Bipartisan collaboration across the government is still very possible, and this work will help cement our country's global leadership in mobile innovation.

947632,"Huffington Post : ""All Labor Has Dignity"": King's Other Legacy",9,"By Thomas Perez

A few weeks ago, I saw Selma, a remarkable movie about the unbreakable persistence and moral leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the struggle to secure voting rights for African-Americans in the Jim Crow south.

But what the movie didn't reveal was the role played by the labor movement in the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery and its part in propelling the civil rights movement forward at so many pivotal moments. As we mark Dr. King's 86th birthday, it is my hope that Americans will remember another less-celebrated element of his dream -- a belief in the importance of unions, labor rights and robust worker voice.

As the U.S. Secretary of Labor, and also the former Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, my work is animated by Dr. King's view that civil rights and labor rights are inextricably intertwined. ""The duality of interests of labor and Negroes,"" he told the AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention in 1961, ""makes any crisis which lacerates you, a crisis from which we bleed."" Both movements are rooted in the idea that empowerment comes when many people speak with one voice, rallying as a community, taking collective action.

Going back to the Montgomery Bus Boycott nearly a decade earlier, the key strategist was a local leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters named E.D. Nixon, who saw the galvanizing potential of Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat at the front of the bus. Labor leaders like Walter Reuther, A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin were also the driving organizational force behind the 1963 March on Washington, a demonstration that was about economic justice as well as racial emancipation (the full name was actually ""The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"").

Dr. King's ties and fellowship with the labor movement were deep. Selma opens with King accepting the Nobel Peace Prize -- it doesn't mention that one of his first tasks upon returning from Oslo to his hometown of Atlanta was to picket with striking workers at the Scripto pen factory.

Union members, from the rank-and-file up to representatives of the AFL-CIO Executive Council, came to march in Selma. Among those locking arms on the Edmund Pettus Bridge was Reuther of the United Auto Workers. It was also Reuther who posted bail after Dr. King's 1963 arrest in Birmingham. And the UAW provided the Detroit office space where King wrote his most iconic speech: ""I Have a Dream"".

Civil rights activists and union activists shared not just common values and objectives, but also common enemies. The same mounted posse that bashed and brutalized marchers on Bloody Sunday, a harrowing scene vividly reenacted in Selma, was first assembled by Sheriff Jim Clark to harass union organizers at a local packing plant several years earlier.

Central to King's philosophy was the idea that men and women of all races deserve the dignity of work, the right to earn more than poverty wages. And he knew that goal was not attainable without full-throated worker voice. Here is Dr. King speaking to the Illinois AFL-CIO in 1965:

""The labor movement was the principal force that transformed misery and despair into hope and progress. Out of its bold struggles, economic and social reform gave birth to unemployment insurance, old age pensions, government relief for the destitute, and, above all, new wage levels that meant not mere survival but a tolerable life.""

Dr. King's last campaign was a labor struggle. Many people are aware that King was assassinated in Memphis in the spring of 1968. Less well-known is what drew him there: solidarity with city sanitation workers, who, without the benefit of union representation, were rising up to protest humiliating pay and deplorable working conditions.

The catalyzing event was the gruesome death of two workers, crushed by a malfunctioning hydraulic ram in the back of a sanitation truck. The hard-working civil servants who picked up Memphis' garbage were tired of being treated like garbage. They walked off the job and organized under the proud, defiant banner, powerful in its simplicity: ""I Am a Man.""

Representatives from the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) came to town to help negotiate, but the recalcitrant Mayor, Henry Loeb, refused to come to the table. Mayhem broke out in the streets when police turned mace and nightsticks on marching strikers.

Arriving in Memphis on March 18 and declaring that ""all labor has dignity"", King spontaneously urged a general work stoppage -- not just in sanitation, but workers of all kinds throughout the city. He would return twice in the coming weeks. And on April 3, in his final speech, he seemed to foreshadow his own personal demise even as he imagined the ultimate triumph of the movement: ""I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.""

Less than 24 hours later, he was gunned down while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel. Within two weeks, the strike was settled. The city recognized the union and granted the sanitation workers a raise.

Nearly half a century later, workers' struggle for fair pay, decent benefits and economic security remains one of the pressing challenges of our time. With a declining percentage of workers belonging to unions, wages have stagnated and the middle class has suffered. Around the country, reactionary forces continue to exert their considerable power to try to muzzle worker voice.

But time and again, we see Dr. King's influence in mass mobilizations of people peacefully petitioning for their rights at work. We see it in the ongoing campaign by fast food workers to get the raise they deserve. We saw it in Madison, Wisconsin in 2011 -- thousands descending on the state capitol to protest a state law stripping public employees of collective bargaining rights. To ensure an economy based on shared prosperity, we must grow these movements, identifying new and innovative ways to lift up worker voice.

And as we do, we must continue to turn for inspiration to Dr. King. The King Holiday is a celebration of many things -- his pursuit of racial justice, his commitment to non-violent resistance, his belief in service and doing for others. But you might also call it the other Labor Day."
947860,Mulshine Column on Sen. Menendez' Record in Mideast was Faulty: Opinion,9,"By Robert Menendez

Paul Mulshine is critical of my approach to foreign policy in a column that omits facts, distorts the historical record, creates false associations, and twists chronological events.

He seeks to advise Gov. Chris Christie, who is traveling to London next month, on international affairs. I would caution the governor against reading much into Mr. Mulshine's writings.

Mulshine argues that blame for the woes befalling the Middle East rests with Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and other neoconservatives who destabilized the Middle East by supporting the toppling of Saddam Hussein. 

He insinuates by omission that I belong in this category.

One significant problem: I voted in opposition to President Bush's ill-conceived gambit in Iraq.

My metric was straightforward. I would never send our sons and daughters into a war that I would be unwilling to send my own son or daughter to fight in. That ""no' vote was a defining moment of my career in Congress.

The central pillar upon which this column stands misrepresents my record.

Much of it focuses on Syria and the Islamic State, where Mulshine criticizes me for pushing the U.S. ""to take an active role in supporting the rebels fighting to oust Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.""

But that exact position is the administration's policy, arguing that ""Assad must go"" and supporting the training and equipping of the Syrian opposition. President Barack Obama over Labor Day 2013 even came within minutes of approving air strikes against Assad for gassing Syrians and crossing his self-imposed red line.

It is also the position of Senators from liberal Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to conservative Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) who voted with me in September 2013 to provide lethal and non-lethal assistance to vetted Syrian opposition groups.

Mulshine is free to disagree, but if he wants to cast blame, it should be distributed evenly amongst nearly all officials in power from President Obama, to Secretary Kerry, to former Secretary Clinton, on down who understand that the Assad regime has lost its legitimacy.

It is well-documented that the assistance to the Syrian opposition never adequately materialized despite congressional urging, including my own and as a result, President Assad's hold on power was never seriously challenged. Now, in recent years, ISIL has emerged filling the void in Syria and Iraq.

""The president could sure use some sympathy from the senator who helped get him into this mess,"" decries the author. 

To which I respond, which mess?

The Iraq War mess, which I opposed?

The mess of supporting the Syrian opposition, which the Administration, many Democratic and Republican senators supported?

Or is it the mess caused by ISIS in Iraq, a direct outgrowth of former Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki's sectarian policies that rewarded the Shia and penalized the Sunni in Iraq? And who did Maliki take his orders from? None other than Iran, a country Mulshine portrays as a solution to what ails the region.

Writes the author: ""If he [President Obama] wants to beat back the Sunni [ISIL] forces who've taken over much of Iraq, he needs the help of the Shias who run Iran.""

It's not altruism motivating Iran in fighting ISIL in Iraq, or for that matter, in destabilizing Yemen, propping up Assad in Syria, or arming Hezbollah and Hamas. 

Rather, it is Iran's regional ambitions, coupled with a track record of obfuscating its nuclear weapons program, and misleading the international community.

That should give all of us serious pause. Iran, a nation that funds terrorism, is neither America's friend nor ally.

I have introduced bipartisan legislation that encourages continued negotiations with Iran resulting in the dismantlement of their illicit nuclear weapons program, and that does not introduce one new sanction against Iran during this final phase of talks culminating on June 30th.

The bill's Democratic supporters agreed not to vote on this bill before March 24, a deadline set by the six negotiating partners and Iran to achieve a political framework agreement. But we remain deeply skeptical of Iran's intentions.

The Mulshine approach of telling ""people gas is cheap these days, so they can forget about the Mideast"" is wishful thinking, not borne in reality.
If diplomacy is not successful or should Iran walk away from negotiations, a logical and gradually accelerated series of tough penalties await Iran.

The Mulshine approach of telling ""people gas is cheap these days, so they can forget about the Mideast"" is wishful thinking, not borne in reality.

Columnists have license to express their views and certainly disagree with me in making their arguments. 

But distorting my record and engaging in historical revisionism to arrive at that conclusion is an abuse of the privilege they are afforded."
948644,CNN - Made in America Makes a Comeback,9,"By Penny Pritzker and Mike Froman

Thanks to the resilience of U.S. workers and businesses of all sizes, ""Made in America"" is making a comeback.

According to data released last week by the Department of Commerce, American businesses exported $2.35 trillion in goods and services in 2014, hitting a record high for the fifth straight year. The United States sold more to our 20 free trade partners than ever before and logged record exports to more than 50 overseas markets.

This is good news all around -- for our economy, workers and wages. After all, U.S. exports have been one of the primary drivers of America's economic resurgence, contributing one-third of our economic growth since 2009 and supporting 11.3 million jobs in 2013. With those jobs paying up to 18% more, on average, than jobs not related to exports, trade promotion has an important role to play in boosting the incomes of middle class Americans.

Yet America's recovery remains incomplete, and unfair foreign practices are threatening our progress. Today, many of our workers are competing against counterparts in countries that lack basic labor rights. Meanwhile, some foreign governments are further skewing the playing field by providing subsidies and encouraging competition without concern for the environment.

At stake is not merely America's status as a place that makes real things, but more fundamentally, the strength of our middle class and the sanctity of our values. When worker rights aren't respected abroad, the human toll is measured both in American jobs and in a deficit of dignity for workers around the world. Likewise, the absence of environmental protections beyond our borders puts workers and businesses at a competitive disadvantage here at home while jeopardizing the health of our waters, wildlife, air and other treasures that span national boundaries.

In the face of these challenges, trade agreements are among our best tools for defending American interests and values.

Just look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that the United States is negotiating with 11 other countries in the Asia-Pacific and which includes nearly 40% of the global economy. If agreement can be reached, the deal would grow U.S. exports by more than $120 billion a year, one study estimates, and support more well-paying jobs.

Most importantly, the TPP will allow the United States to level the playing field for our workers and businesses in the world's fastest-growing region. At present, American autoworkers are handicapped by tariffs that can reach 30% in rapidly growing markets such as Malaysia. For their part, American farmers are forced to contend with tariffs as high as 40% on poultry in Vietnam. In these industries and others, TPP will eliminate or significantly reduce barriers to U.S. exports.

Additionally, TPP will contain the toughest environmental and labor protections of any trade agreement in history, including the first provisions to combat the trade in illegal wildlife and the products of illegal fishing, among other advances.

The benefits of TPP are clear, while the alternative to leading on trade is alarming. In recent years, countries in the Asia-Pacific have struck over 200 trade agreements, while U.S. companies and workers have largely missed out. China has been extremely active, and we cannot afford to sit on the sidelines.

While passing TPP will start a race to the top, ceding leadership to others could result in a race to the bottom. Not leading on trade would undercut our capacity to safeguard labor rights, environmental protections, a free and open Internet, a level playing field between state-owned companies and our private businesses, and a host of provisions which unite America's interests and values.

Getting this done will require unity of effort. In calling for bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority, President Barack Obama has invited Congress to assert its role on trade and provide guidance to the executive branch, including on issues that have emerged since that authority was last updated in 2002, such as the role of state-owned companies and the digital economy.

As the President said during his State of the Union address, 95% of the world's customers live outside the United States. No savvy entrepreneur would leave that much of the market untapped. Passing a bipartisan trade promotion bill is an important step toward opening those markets, unlocking opportunity for all Americans and advancing the first trade agenda that's as progressive as it is pro-growth."
948697,The Hill - Citizens United Anniversary Shows Need for Campaign Finance Reform,9,"By Reps. David Price and Chris Van Hollen

This month marks the fifth anniversary of the Supreme Court's deeply misguided Citizens United decision, which unleashed a tidal wave of outside money in our elections, with no end in sight. Each successive election since 2010 has seen an increase in the amount of money spent by candidates, parties, outside groups and individuals. The 2014 cycle cost close to $4 billion for congressional races, making them the most expensive midterm elections; the 2012 cycle cost $6.3 billion for presidential and congressional races, an overall record that will almost certainly be broken in the 2016 cycle. And much of that funding came from anonymous donors and organizations with minimal oversight from the Federal Election Commission.

All of this money is overwhelming and poisoning our political system. It purchases attack ads that saturate the airwaves without giving a clue whose money is behind them. These ads drown out other voices, sometimes even those of the candidates and parties themselves, taking our politics in extreme directions, emphasizing ideological purity at the expense of bipartisanship and cooperation. Numerous analysts have directly linked out-of-control campaign financing to congressional dysfunction.

The most effective solution would be a constitutional amendment or a reversal of the Supreme Court's relevant decisions. Neither is likely at present, and the kind of broad reform we both favor thus faces formidable political and legal obstacles.
However, we strongly believe that Congress can still make significant progress by focusing on specific, targeted priorities. At a recent press conference, we joined colleagues from the Senate to announce that we will be reintroducing legislation to require disclosure of contributions by outside spending groups and to tighten the rules that prohibit collaboration between candidates and super-PACs that support them.

Even as it opened the floodgates in Citizens United, the Court made clear that requiring groups to disclose their donors or sponsors, forcing them to ""stand by"" their TV ads, was perfectly compatible with the First Amendment. Surely, anyone who feels strongly enough to provide tens of millions of dollars to support or defeat a political candidate should be willing to stand proudly by that investment, and voters have a right to know who is funding ""independent"" spending groups. That's why we reintroduced the DISCLOSE Act. 

Disclosure used to be grounds for bipartisan agreement. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), perhaps today's strongest congressional opponent of common-sense campaign finance reform, was once a supporter of robust disclosure requirements. Now, he portrays them as a threat to donor privacy and freedom of speech. Surely level-headed lawmakers from both parties can see through the spin and agree that, when it comes to elections, more transparency is never a bad thing.

Our second priority is ensuring that independent groups are not coordinating with the campaigns they support. In the 2012 election, some super-PACs for the first time dedicated themselves solely to the election of a single candidate. These super-PACs, sharing an objective, strategy and reason for existence with the campaigns, have now proliferated. Still they aren't subject to donation caps because of their supposed independence. A combination of weak FEC regulations and rare enforcement has, in effect, removed the limits on contributions to individual political campaigns. 

Individual-candidate super-PACs and individual campaigns are also openly sharing everything from media strategies to B-roll for advertisements, exploiting a legal loophole that allows outside groups to essentially function as an extension of the campaign. This obviously violates the spirit of the statutory prohibition on coordination, but the provisions of the law are opaque and have not been effectively enforced.

That's why we reintroduced the Empowering Citizens Act -- legislation that would clarify and strengthen the ban on candidate coordination with outside spending groups. It would stop a candidate's associates or family members from running a super-PAC supporting that candidate and would also limit the ability of candidates to raise money for super-PACs supporting them.

The unchecked and rapid rise of new organizations solely designed to circumvent campaign finance law should be a call to action for Congress. It is time to implement new, robust protections against coordination between campaigns and individual-candidate super-PACs. If coupled with adequate disclosure of the hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money spent each cycle, these reforms would mean real progress toward restoring faith in the electoral process."
948703,The Guardian - A Nuclear Agreement with Iran will Make us Safer. Peremptory Demands from Congress Won't,9,"By Rep. David Price

The new Republican leadership in Congress has indicated that new, punitive measures against Iran might be among its first orders of business, even though diplomatic talks with our international alliance are entering a promising new stage. If my colleagues are serious about restraining Iran's nuclear ambitions, they will resist the temptation to intervene and instead let our negotiators finish the job.

Altering the terms or objectives of the talks would amount to moving the goalposts when the end zone is in sight -- with potentially devastating consequences.

November's four-month extension of the ""P5+1"" negotiations (called so because of the participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) confirmed both the difficulty of the remaining issues and the importance of continuing to negotiate. We are still several steps short of a complete and lasting termination of Iran's nuclear weapons program, but the current interim agreement between Iran and the international community -- known as the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) -- is a vast improvement over 18 months ago, when Iran's nuclear program was still expanding and shrouded in secrecy.

While the JPOA is only a temporary agreement, Iran has complied with it and verifiably frozen and rolled back its nuclear program, demonstrating that it is willing to take negotiations seriously.

Congress could play an important oversight role while negotiators work to build on this progress and secure a verifiable and lasting nuclear agreement with Iran. But acting peremptorily to demand specific concessions from Iran could destabilize the diplomatic balance needed for negotiations to both continue and ultimately succeed. It would be unwise, for example, to lay out unrealistic or overly-specific requirements for a final agreement to be acceptable to Congress.

Likewise, the nuclear negotiating table is not the place to compel Iran to clean up its act on issues unrelated to nonproliferation. Iran engages in an array of behaviors that the US and the international community find unacceptable, such as persecuting political opponents and religious minorities, and supporting terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. But we must not insist that everything be solved before anything is solved; a nuclear agreement is and should be our first priority, and such an agreement could facilitate progress on other fronts.

Imposing new or less flexible economic sanctions -- which has been proposed by a number of my congressional colleagues, including Senators Kirk and Menendez -- could do great damage to our prospects for a nuclear agreement with Iran. New punitive action could strengthen Iranian hard-liners and make their withdrawal from the negotiations more likely. Acting unilaterally could also undermine the stability of our international alliance, and thereby actually weaken the existing international sanctions regime.

The existing sanctions are, of course, a major reason that Iran is at the negotiating table, and Congress should stand ready to reimpose and strengthen them should Iran violate the terms of the JPOA or any future nuclear agreement. But taking punitive action now could send a message that Congress does not stand behind the negotiators.

We cannot lose sight of the fact that a verifiable nuclear agreement with Iran would make our country, Israel, the Middle East and the world much safer. The nuclear talks with Iran could still crumble under the pressure of opposition and distrust both inside and outside Iran. But the United States and the international community must press ahead -- because of the security that the removal of the nuclear threat would bring and the dire alternatives we'll face if negotiations fail."
948794,The Hill - David Vitter: Ushering in a New Small Biz Committee,9,"The reason why the saying ""small business is the backbone of the American economy"" is so popular is because it's true. Unfortunately, what's also true is that Washington has never placed more crushing weights on that backbone. The Obama administration has unleashed an unprecedented onslaught of regulations that affect every small business in the country. And then there's the biggest and worst impediment: ObamaCare.

Thanks to the Obama administration, business owners have to deal with hours of extra paperwork and compliance costs rather than spending their limited time and resources on more productive, job-growing activities. I've heard from many small-business owners who have said that, for the first time in their careers, they are not looking to grow their businesses in order to avoid paying higher healthcare costs. That's tragic and scary.

As the newly elected chairman of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I'm sure as heck going to do my part to reverse that trend. I'm committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to shape policy that will help.
We essentially have to get the federal government out of the way so that small businesses can do what they do best: create jobs and boost the economy while providing excellent products and service. In other words, carry on and expand the American dream.

Among my priorities on the Small Business Committee are growing our domestic energy industry, getting rid of the government impediments to growth and capital formation, reducing the tax burden on small businesses and, of course, repealing and replacing ObamaCare.

Already, the new committee has held a hearing -- not in Washington, D.C., but in the real world, specifically Bossier City, La. There we were able to hear real-life stories of how small businesses are dealing with ObamaCare implementation, often by shrinking jobs.

Small businesses have limited access to healthcare choices and financial assistance to procure health insurance for their employees. Due to the massive bureaucratic mess, small businesses are facing major uncertainty in terms of determining whether or not they are subject to the employer mandate, are able to grow their businesses, are able to create jobs. Instead, small businesses are spending hours wading through complex accounting methods to figure out their business size and who is eligible for subsidies.

This kind of regulatory morass is a prime example of how government is holding small businesses back from succeeding. Like I said, some are not even looking to grow their businesses in order to avoid higher costs. One ObamaCare provision says that small businesses with more than 50 employees have to pay higher fees and deal with more red tape, which is why many businesses are avoiding hiring that 51st employee.

But guess who's doing just fine with their healthcare through all of this? Congress. While small businesses suffer, Congress and the Obama administration created a loophole and designated itself a ""small business"" so they can keep their taxpayer-funded subsidy for ObamaCare by purchasing their plans through the District of Columbia Small Business Exchange. Nobody believes Congress is a small business.

I've dubbed this scenario Washington's ObamaCare exemption, and it is completely unfair -- even by Washington standards. I introduced legislation that would force the Washington elite, including all members of Congress, all congressional staff, the president, vice president, and all political appointees within the administration, to purchase their health insurance on the Obama-Care exchange, like the law intended, without this absurd abuse of the Small Business Exchange allowing Congress to enjoy a huge taxpayer-funded subsidy.

We discussed all of this at our recent field hearing too.

With this year's work on the Small Business Committee, we'll continue to make sure that the voices and concerns of small businesses across the country are heard. We'll focus on regulatory reforms to reduce the paperwork burden and compliance costs for small businesses and eliminate disincentives for growth.

There's clearly a lot of work to do, but we're up for it. And we want to send the message that the Small Business Committee is here to truly work for and with America's small businesses. We can start by getting rid of some of ObamaCare's outrageous burdens, and by making Congress live under ObamaCare the same way the rest of America does. As a very practical matter, the sooner Washington eats its own cooking, the sooner it will start getting things right -- on ObamaCare and a lot more."
948858,Wall Street Journal - Essential Elements to a G-20 Growth Plan,9,"By Jacob J. Lew and George Osborne

Over the past few years, our two governments have worked to fuel economic growth, create jobs and improve living standards. Our economies are now growing solidly.

However, finance ministers and central-bank governors from the G-20 nations gather on Monday in Istanbul against a backdrop of challenges. Global growth is forecast to slow. Deflationary risks are evident in some regions. There is a shortfall in demand. And we face rising geopolitical risks from Ukraine and the Middle East that require coordinated action.

Our message at the G-20 is this: Governments must use the full set of tools they have at their disposal to support their economies and realize the collective G-20 objective of strong, sustainable and balanced global growth.

Any comprehensive plan must include three crucial ingredients.

First, fiscal policies must maintain a responsible fiscal path while ensuring sufficient resources for education and infrastructure investment for the future. In the U.K. and U.S., fiscal deficits have fallen by half as a share of gross domestic product in the context of stronger economic growth, spending reductions and revenue increases. Precise requirements will differ by country, but all countries need credible plans that can be flexibly implemented.

Crucially, plans must be designed to protect the most growth-enhancing investments. The burden of reducing deficits must be shared fairly. In the U.K. and the U.S., action was taken to ensure that those with the broadest shoulders bear the greatest burden. In addition to prior actions in the U.S., additional measures to bolster the middle class and lower our deficits were contained in President Obama's budget proposals last week. At an international level, the G-20 must continue eliminating incentives for tax avoidance and cracking down on tax evasion, including through coordination and increased transparency.

Second, central banks are playing a critical role in supporting accommodative credit conditions that encourage business and household spending and counter deflationary pressures. Forceful monetary-policy actions in the U.S. and U.K. were essential in helping our economies recover after the global financial crisis. But central banks cannot do the job alone.

The third ingredient for a comprehensive economic plan must be the implementation of pro-growth structural economic reforms to boost productivity and raise living standards. Domestically that must include better infrastructure, support for small businesses, regulatory reforms that safeguard financial stability and improved education for all. It must also include strong efforts to address impediments that make certain economies structurally less competitive, including the variety of rigidities that constrain growth in several European countries.

We share a common interest with our European partners in seeing Greece sustain and build upon its hard-fought progress on reforms. In close consultation with its European and international partners, it is important that Greece implement a credible and comprehensive approach to reform, recovery and economic growth. At the European level, there needs to be renewed momentum to complete the single market for services and capital. The entire Continent must do more to support growth and jobs, recognizing that countries have varying degrees of fiscal space.

All countries must also honor their G-7, G-20 and International Monetary Fund exchange-rate commitments and obligations. Internationally, we must all strive for further progress on trade agreements that benefit our workers and reflect our values. We are working to conclude a comprehensive EU-U.S. trade deal that would significantly expand trade between our nations and support new opportunities for millions of workers in both Europe and the U.S.

A comprehensive approach utilizing all three ingredients would help dispel uncertainty and inspire the confidence needed for investment and growth.

Finally, the best laid plans can be undone by geopolitical shocks, so we need to contain risks, especially in Ukraine where the situation is of increasing concern. In the end, this crisis needs a political solution. The EU and the U.S. have worked closely together to impose costs on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and must be prepared to do more if the situation deteriorates, while leaving open a diplomatic off-ramp if Russia chooses to change course. At the same time, we need to ensure sufficient financial support for Ukraine, including increased support from the U.S., Europe and international institutions as Ukraine undertakes essential economic reforms.

In an uncertain world there is once again an urgent need for international coordination to confront problems, contain risks and deliver a comprehensive plan for strong, sustainable and balanced growth."
948890,Huffington Post - Bipartisan Action to Crack Down on Sex Trafficking,9,"By John Cornyn and Amy Klobuchar

When many Americans think about sex trafficking, they often envision brothels in foreign cities or girls being smuggled across far away borders. But what many may not realize is that this isn't just happening a world away, it's happening right in our own backyard. Over 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are actually U.S. citizens. And shockingly, the average age of a child when she first becomes a victim is just 13 years old. Not even old enough to drive a car or go to her high school prom.

We need to look at sex trafficking as part of a larger issue on how we treat women in our country and how we portray ourselves internationally to the rest of the world. If the U.S. is going to lead the world in promoting women's rights, then we have to show the world that we're making the fight against sex trafficking a top priority and tackling it head-on in our own country, and then help these countries do the same. We must take a stand against this modern-day slavery and lift up the status of women and girls across the world.

We need to be doing everything we can to fight this heinous crime and support these victims. But right now, minors who are sold for sex can be prosecuted as criminals in many states. This is downright wrong. These young children need our support, not to be locked up in jail.

That's why we have introduced the bipartisan Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking (SETT) Act that would incentivize states to adopt ""safe harbor"" laws that ensure kids sold for sex aren't prosecuted as defendants, but rather are treated as victims. Minnesota and fourteen other states already have laws like these on the books -- now we need to make it national.
This fight is a team effort. That is why our bill also would help law enforcement officers, prosecutors, officials and advocates get on the same page by creating a National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking to help coordinate their efforts across the country and by strengthening the National Human Trafficking Hotline that helps connect victims with services and passes on crime tips to law enforcement.

In addition to keeping victims out of jail, we also must do everything we can to keep them from being swallowed back into the dark world of the sex trade. We must support victims as they rebuild their lives to help them permanently escape the cycle of violence and abuse. That is why we have introduced a bill called the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA) that would bring greater restitution and enhanced services for victims while helping law enforcement to crack down on sex trafficking across the country.  By increasing the fees and fines on perpetrators, the bill is expected to bring in about $30 million each year to help pay for shelters and other services for victims.

We must take action to combat sex trafficking all around the world. But we must first start in our own backyard. Whether it's ensuring the 12-year old sold for sex in Houston is treated as the victim that she is or cracking down on the pimp who seeks out vulnerable young people in downtown Minneapolis, we must do everything we can to stop this heinous crime."
949285,Indian Country Today Media Network - Empowering Indian Country in the new Republican Majority,9,"By John Barrasso

It has been eight years since a Republican Majority was elected to lead the United States Senate. No matter which party is in charge, the American people want action and solutions, not dysfunction.

As Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I am committed to a results-driven agenda focusing on enhancing tribal self-determination and self-governance. I think former President Reagan said it best when describing government: ""Government's first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives.""

Perhaps to the surprise of some, Republicans have been active in establishing or enacting landmark tribal policy. President Richard Nixon authored the Special Message to the Congress on Indian Affairs. President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. My predecessors, as Chairmen of the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senators Ben Nighthorse Campbell and John McCain championed trust reform, Indian health care, and the protection of women from domestic violence.

The federal government has not done well in meeting that first duty or its specific responsibilities to Indian country. Tribal members face far too many challenges in so many areas including health care, education, and economic development. Solutions, not the status quo, are needed to address these challenges.

During this Congress, the Committee will hold hearings and meet with tribal leaders on how Congress can help empower tribes. We must reverse government policies that work to the detriment of tribes. Based on this discourse, I intend to develop and introduce legislation aimed at cutting red tape to provide a greater opportunity for economic development in Indian country.

The Committee will hold a series of oversight hearings aimed at identifying the many issues impacting tribal development. Many additional issues are poised for and in need of Committee attention. These include housing, education, irrigation, Indian child protection, and substance abuse prevention.

As a doctor, I understand these issues all too well from the two tribes I represent in my home state of Wyoming, the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone Tribe.

The first bill I introduced as chairman is the Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self Determination Act. It has six cosponsors and I expect many more members will support us. This bipartisan bill will promote more tribal autonomy and decision making in the energy sector. We are committed to giving the power back to the tribes and not the federal government. As the National Congress of American Indians President Brian Cladoosby said recently, this bill will ""create careers and capital in Indian Country.""

I look forward to working together in the years ahead as we continue to strengthen our relationship based on both respect and trust. Together, we can improve the lives of Native Americans and make progress in helping tribal families, communities, and businesses succeed."
949403,Washington Examiner - Obama Has Bad Judgment Picking Friends,9,"The feckless foreign policy forays of our President beg for some critical understanding. His initiatives have not only left America more vulnerable than since Pearl Harbor or Sept. 11, but they have sent terrible signals to friends and encouraged provocation from our adversaries. The most recent diplomatic normalization with Cuba once again tells the world that he either doesn't understand terrorists, or seemingly has some measure of guilt or sympathy for those who deride American interests.

President Obama has been consistent. He has demonstrated deference, apology, and weakness time and again, from appeasing Iran, changing his mind on Syria, standing down on missile defense, lowering our Army and Navy readiness force, no meaningful commitment to Ukraine, and now Cuba.

Let's take a look at Cuba. At a House Financial Services Committee briefing on Jan. 27, 2015, the State Department's Acting Deputy Director for the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs and Caribbean, Mary Brett Rogers-Spring, provided testimony regarding the President's decision to recognize Cuba with diplomatic privileges.

In her opening statement, Ms. Rogers-Spring conveyed that the State Department was currently conducting a review of the status of Cuba as a designated ""terrorist state."" Rogers-Spring could not answer the question of why this investigation was not conducted prior to President Obama's decision to lift sanctions and provide full diplomatic status. Of note, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria are the four countries listed by the State Department as state sponsors of terrorism. And just four months ago, the Administration determined that trade with Cuba was not in the best interest of America's national security.

During further questioning, I asked Ms. Rogers-Spring to respond to the following major concerns that, by any measure, should be impediments to the privileged economic status of formal relations with the United States:

1. Cuba is the first and only country in the Western Hemisphere to have cooperated with North Korea to smuggle arms (which were intercepted) in contravention of UN Security Council prohibitions. As the Administration's own Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, described it, the act was ""a cynical, outrageous and illegal attempt by Cuba and North Korea to circumvent United Nations sanctions.""

2. Cuba is harboring Joanne Chesimard, who is designated as a ""domestic terrorist"" and on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist List.

3. Cuba harbors Frank Terpil, a US fugitive and rogue CIA agent, who, in a BBC documentary, recounts working for Moammar Gadhafi's political hit squads.

4. Cuba continues to harbor Revolution Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) terrorists.

Additional basis for Cuba to remain listed as a state sponsor of terrorism include:

1. Cuba continues to permit 70 fugitives wanted by the United States to reside in Cuba, and provides them with food, housing, and medical care.

2. In addition to Cuba's relationship with FARC terrorists, Cuba exhibits a long history of providing a safe haven and cooperating with Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA).

3. On May 12, 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry issued a determination and certification that Cuba ""[is] not cooperating fully with United States antiterrorism efforts.""

Nothing has changed in regards to Cuba's dangerous behavior toward the United States, the Western Hemisphere, or its own people, who continue to be oppressed and denied basic human rights. What has changed is that President Obama sees himself and America's place as the leader of the Free World much differently than the nine Presidents who preceded him.

So, President Obama's diplomacy is to elevate and honor a known terrorist-sponsoring state, while giving a snub to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his upcoming visit to the United States, when he will bring a clear perspective regarding the greatest threat we face in Iran.

Are we back to Jack Nicholson, Mr. President? ""The truth, you can't handle the truth?""

In my meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu during trips to Israel, along with other heads of state in the Middle East, I found they don't understand our President. The Crown Prince in the UAE said, ""We should be joined with the United States and Israel to defeat the Islamic extremist terrorists.""

Mr. President, you didn't seem to get the basic training in your youth to understand bad guys and how to pick your friends. The problem is that our national security has floundered, and we face graver and more perilous threats because of your naïve understanding of human nature and your bad judgment."
949481,"USA Today - Sens. Alexander, Blunt & Sasse: Smart Aid for Collegians",9,"By Lamar Alexander, Roy Blunt and Ben Sasse

President Obama was in the right church but the wrong pew when he proposed providing free community college tuition for some students.

The president was right to celebrate the Tennessee Promise to make two years at community colleges or technical institutes tuition free for graduating high school seniors. Using the presidential bully pulpit in this way will cause other states to ask, ""If Tennessee can do it, what can we do to make higher education or workforce preparation work better in our state?""

Obama was also right to support legislation simplifying the absurd 108-question federal student aid application form. Its complexity discourages up to 2 million students from applying for federal aid, according to testimony before the U.S. Senate's education committee.

The president was wrong to try to turn one state's good idea into a huge new federal program. This would put the federal government in charge of regulating the 13th and 14th grades of U.S. education. It would deny students the option to use this new federal aid at private 2-year or 4-year institutions or 4-year public universities, a choice that has been available since 1944 when Congress passed the first federal college access program -- the GI Bill. It would spend as much as $60 billion in federal dollars mostly to help students whose income is not low enough to qualify for existing federal aid.

All three of us were university presidents before we became U.S. senators. We have seen firsthand how the generous system of federal student aid works. More than half of America's 20 million college students have a federal grant or loan to help pay for college. Taxpayers loan $100 billion a year at low rates to students without asking for a credit check and with generous repayment terms.

In addition, taxpayers give $33 billion annually to 9.2 million students in federal Pell Grants of up to $5,730. One third of these Pell Grants are used at community colleges -- where 37% of students have a Pell Grant and the average annual tuition is $3,300. In 16 states -- including California, Texas and Florida -- the average Pell Grant received by a community college student covers the entire tuition bill.

The president's program would use federal dollars to make community college free for students who either didn't qualify for Pell because their household income was too high, or because Pell didn't cover the entire cost of their education. Instead of creating an expensive new federal program that misses the mark, the president and Congress should enact bipartisan legislation introduced this month by six senators that would:

Reduce the Free Application for Financial Student Aid (FAFSA) form from 108-questions to just two questions: 1) What is your family size? And, 2) 

What was your household income two years ago?

Allow high school juniors to learn how much in federal aid they are eligible for as they start to look at colleges.

Streamline the federal grant and loan programs by combining two federal grant programs into one Pell Grant program and reducing the six different federal loan programs into three.

Restore year-round Pell Grant availability and provide flexibility so students can study at their own pace.

Discourage over-borrowing.

Simplify repayment options.

Community colleges are the best buy and the most nimble part of higher education. If you want to change those two things, the surest way to do that is a new federal program that misses the mark. Instead, we recommend letting other states do for themselves what Tennessee has done if it fits their circumstances. The right way for the federal government to help is pay for new Pell Grants that will be applied for and awarded if other states emulate ""Tennessee Promise"" and if Congress reduces paperwork and allows students to use Pell Grants year-round."
949485,Knoxville News Sentinel - Lamar Alexander: Reduce Questions to Apply for Pell Grants,9,"There is nothing like a visit from the president of the United States to shine the spotlight on a really good idea. Gov. Bill Haslam's really good idea was to make Tennessee the first state to say to every high school graduate: Two years of community college or technical education are yours, tuition-free.

For the last 30 years, Tennessee's greatest need has been for better-trained workers to fill the jobs created by companies attracted to our business-friendly, centrally located state. Community colleges and technical institutes are our secret weapon for this kind of training, and too many Tennesseans don't take advantage of them.

When the governor -- and now the president -- say that two years of advanced education are not only free but important, people listen.

Last year, I held roundtable discussions at four of our two-year institutions and learned that applications for admission have doubled or tripled. The reason, obviously, is Tennessee Promise. But I also learned that there's a major obstacle to more students taking advantage of Tennessee Promise, and it's not more money -- it's federal paperwork.

The paperwork comes as part of the deal with Tennessee Promise. Every participant must first apply for a federal Pell Grant, which can cover tuition and fees up to $5,700 a year. Pell Grants can make tuition free for students before they even get into Tennessee Promise. In fact, more than half of Tennessee community college students, including 47 percent of students at Pellissippi State Community College, have a Pell Grant. Tennessee Pell recipients receive, on average, $3,268 in federal student aid per year. Tuition and fees at Pellissippi are $3,660. What the governor and the Legislature did was say to Tennessee students: We'll make up the difference -- on average about $500 a year.

The trouble is with the application for Pell grants. It's 108 questions. The paper version of this dreaded FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) stretches taller than I am. Experts tell us that its complexity discourages an estimated 2 million students from applying each year. At Southwest Tennessee Community College in Memphis alone, the complexity of this form discourages 1,500 students each semester from attending, the school's president told me.

So here's another really good idea: Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, and I introduced a bill this week to simplify the FAFSA by cutting it from 108 questions to two. Experts tell us that two questions about family size and income are really the only ones we need.

As governor in 1983, I saw what happened when President Ronald Reagan came to Knoxville's Farragut High School to encourage our Legislature to pass our Master Teacher Program. Tennessee became the first in the country to pay teachers more for teaching well. Other states began to emulate what Tennessee was pioneering.

Already other states are calling Haslam asking how they can emulate Tennessee Promise. After the president's visit, there will be more calls. One caution: Reagan did not propose that the federal government mandate and fund Master Teacher Programs. He believed states could figure that out themselves.

So let other states emulate Tennessee's really good idea. And then let's reduce the federal paperwork that is the major obstacle to the success of Tennessee Promise."
949571,The Hill - An Image of America's Retreat from World Stage,9,"Throughout history, a single picture has revealed the world's momentary political reality. Before photography, artistic representations of Caesar entering Rome, Napoleon crossing the Alps and General Washington crossing the Delaware defined periods of history. 

With photography, we are able to see images that define America's role in the pivotal moments of existential threats to our values, faiths and way of life. Moments like President Roosevelt and Winston Churchill sitting beside Josef Stalin in Tehran and later at Yalta, President Kennedy at the City Hall in Berlin and President Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate.

These are all powerful images, and the photographic ones have a common theme: America's essential leadership role in global affairs. In these examples and thousands of others, we can see the world looking at America with respect and the expectation that we will lead in moments critical to the world's future.

This week, the most powerful image that evokes the world's new political reality is a photo featuring several of the world's most significant, influential leaders walking arm-in-arm down a Paris boulevard. These influential leaders, from Europe, Africa and the Middle East, are united in protest against the grotesque barbarism of radical jihad that threatens us all.

But it is not who is in the photo that gives the image its importance. Instead, it is the utter absence of America that gives this picture its profound significance.

If the world needs any further demonstration of America's decline, it is our absence at this potentially defining moment in rallying the nations of the world to defend our values and freedoms. And it is just not an image problem, although the image itself carries the message. It is a substance problem. 

This group of world leaders and millions of others joined together in Paris last weekend to show the entire world that a threat to our principal freedoms is entirely unacceptable and will be resisted. Millions gathered not only because 16 people in France died so tragically. They gathered because those who would pervert their faith in order to lure deluded young people into violent extremism must know that we will all oppose them, no matter what it takes.

How can we reconcile this vital mission with America's utter absence? No excuses are sufficient. No apologies or explanations about bureaucratic ineptitude will be enough to undo the damage caused by our nonappearance. 

Sadly, the president's absence is in fact an accurate reflection of how this administration sees our role in the world. Most of the foreign policy challenges we face -- from ISIS to Syria to Iraq -- have been aggravated by U.S. policy failures under President Obama. Those failures have come from a White House isolated in a wasteland of confusion. 

Shrouded in this fog of indecision and failure, is it any wonder that our government could not find the vision to join with the rest of the world to show purpose in Paris?

It is deeply ironic and appropriate that the events in Paris were all generated by the power of imagery -- cartoons no less. Those events have now produced a new imagery, a picture of global common action in which the United States of America is tragically absent."
949572,CNN - Where's Obama's ISIS Strategy,9,"The burning alive of Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh is yet another reminder that ISIS is intent on testing the utter limits of evil and depravity. But even as our eyes are drawn to the horrors being committed overseas, concern is growing in Washington that the Obama administration's strategy for defeating ISIS is falling short.

Three retired senior military commanders -- with 12 stars between them -- recently came before the Senate Armed Services Committee to give their assessment of the defense and security challenges facing our country. With their uniforms put away, they were free to speak their minds. And all three lamented the confused, directionless wandering that constitutes the current national security strategy of the Obama administration.

The three were especially disturbed by the conduct of military operations that have no clear objectives nor the defined means of achieving them. Gen. James Mattis, a former commander of the U.S. Central Command, for example, called for us to ""come out of our reactive crouch and take a firm strategic stance in defense of our values.""

Gen. Jack Keane, former vice chief of staff of the Army, for his part referred in particular to our inadequate and disjointed efforts against ISIS saying, ""We are reduced to a very piecemeal effort."" He noted that our airstrikes against ISIS targets were supporting ""unproven"" local ground forces, which would ""certainly guarantee that we will be incrementally engaged with one radical group after another with no end in sight.""

All Americans should share their concern.

On the very day these commanders testified, their views ironically were validated by one of the few American successes in recent months: the reported successful defense of the Kurdish town of Kobani on the Syrian/Turkish border.

The irony is that this town -- which had little or nothing to do with the vast challenge to our interests posed by either ISIS or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's murderous regime, and yet still consumed 70% of the airstrikes in our struggle against ISIS over the past months -- has been trumpeted as a key victory by the Obama administration.

In reality, control of Kobani was contested by a confused array of combatants -- including a designated terrorist organization, the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, fighting on the coalition side against ISIS. Meanwhile, U.S. airstrikes are only likely to help the forces of the brutal al-Assad regime, which also is battling ISIS.

This is a collapsing strategy grasping at reeds.

U.S. military resources are being squandered without clear purpose or goal. We are indeed ""incrementally engaged with one radical group after another with no end in sight."" There is an obvious disjoint between the administration's joy at this modest success, and the lack of real progress against the enemy elsewhere.

Despite President Barack Obama's claim in his State of the Union address or the customary boasts of Secretary of State John Kerry in London two days later, most credible reports show that ISIS is growing stronger in Syria. This is especially true in its Syrian strongholds.

We have recently learned that an estimated 20,000 foreign fighters have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIS, an estimated increase of 5,000 in the past three months. The numbers very well could be much larger. In the meantime, the Obama administration's plan to identify, vet, train and deploy a total of 5,000 anti-ISIS fighters -- two years from now -- has gone absolutely nowhere. And even if such forces materialize, when they do arrive on future battlefield perhaps, they may have only limited defensive roles, according to the Pentagon.

With all this in mind, who could possibly see the President's response to the mortal threat posed by ISIS as anything but a flat-out denial of the truth? This is simply not how our country should be responding to such threats to our interests and security.

Last year, Obama laid out the goal of defeating ISIS, but he still has not put forward a comprehensive strategy to accomplish this goal. It is paramount that he does so.

Such a strategy must include the cooperation and support of moderate Muslim nations. As Keane said Sunday, ""Until we bring the countries that are involved and also those that have interest together and put together an alliance and establish a strategy, we're not going to be able to push effectively against (ISIS).""

After years of watching this sickening spiral of foreign policy failures, we desperately need improved vision, a stiffer backbone, wisdom and leadership. Another two years of America's growing impotence and irrelevance is a frightening prospect."
949777,"The Hill - Washington, We Can Do This",9,"By Mark Warner and Kelly Ayotte

By now, everyone has heard of the story of baseball's Oakland Athletics and their 2002 season, immortalized by Michael Lewis in the book (and the movie) Moneyball. Recognizing his team's limitations and scarce resources, Oakland general manager Billy Beane pioneered the use of performance data, rather than unscientific scouting reports, to drive his player draft selections. It is a compelling story, and the result was Oakland's record-setting American League winning streak.

But before Beane and the A's achieved success with what came to be known as Moneyball, there were losing streaks, doubters and cynics.

As we start the new year, Washington is in much the same position, facing poor approval ratings, a dismal performance record and an American public that is understandably doubtful that hyperpartisan Washington can get anything done. Given all the dysfunction, it's easy to assume nothing productive will ever come out of a Washington that's this broken. But while it would be easy to assume that, it would also be wrong.

What if we became more data-driven in our pursuit of better outcomes, and based more of our policy choices and spending decisions on real evidence of effectiveness and efficiency? We could play our own brand of Moneyball, and help Washington turn the tide on behalf of American families.

We're not naive about the historic challenges facing Congress, nor about the gridlock we've seen too much of in recent years. However, we are optimistic about the opportunities for government to adopt a Moneyball approach, and how that could catalyze progress on the many policy challenges we confront.

Moneyball doesn't require Washington to reach a consensus on every big issue. But it does require that we introduce more objective evidence and data analysis into the policymaking process and budget decisions, even as we continue to debate what those policies and dollar allocations should be. Our choices can and should be more informed by what will have the most impact, and what will produce the best results for taxpayers and citizens.

Prioritizing and investing in what works can also heal the partisan divide. Moneyball gives us a chance to modify or eliminate unnecessary programs and focus instead on effective, efficient government. It also provides an opportunity to prove that government, regardless of its size, can help improve outcomes for all Americans.

If we have any hope of bridging the gap between big ideas and implementation, of overcoming the inertia and bias towards inaction, we should adopt an evidence-based agenda. This cannot be the project of a passionate few. It must be a cause taken up and championed in Congress and across the country.

We ask our fellow members of Congress to join us in support of using evidence and data to make better, more-informed decisions. On your committees and in your own legislation, push for the programs you authorize and fund to be rigorously evaluated -- for the sake of the taxpayers and everyone who might benefit from these programs. Help us figure out if what we're doing is working.

To the president, presidential candidates and every agency of the federal government, build on the work you're already doing. Turn evidence-based pilot programs into major initiatives. Show us that these efforts can be part of a more effective delivery of services to our citizens.

Cities, states, foundations, nonprofits and the private sector should continue to incubate their innovative programs and demonstrate that data and evidence can -- and do -- change outcomes and lift the lives of people all across America. Test new approaches, fine tune them, and then bring them to scale.

Our fellow citizens have a role to play as well. Demand accountability. Insist that we evaluate what's working and what isn't, and demand that resources be directed to effective programs and redirected from those that are unnecessary, outdated or duplicative.

It's time for those of us who serve in Washington to play Moneyball."
949808,Deseret News - Tax Reform Shouldn't Penalize Single-Worker Families,9,"By Michael Lee

If you've been following national politics lately, you might have noticed the two political parties seem to have found some common ground. Almost everyone in Washington today is talking about the same thing: helping America's working and middle-class families.

This is a welcome, if overdue, development. Today, far too many moms and dads -- married and single, in Utah and across the country -- are working harder than ever to make ends meet.

But beneath the surface of political spin, there are important differences in how exactly the left and right propose to reduce the burdens holding back American families.

In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama called for ""lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets every year."" As a proponent of tax fairness for families myself, I was encouraged to hear the president acknowledge the struggles of America's working parents.

But the actual policy the president proposed falls short of the standards I believe must guide all government reforms -- standards that he set out himself in the same speech: that ""everyone plays by the same set of rules.""

The problem with the president's proposal is that he wants to cut taxes for only one particular type of family.

Specifically, the president proposed a new $500 tax credit only for families with two incomes, and he called for an increase in the child-care tax credit. That is, he wants to use the tax code to reward two-income couples who put their children in commercial day care, while leaving behind couples who choose to have mom or dad stay at home.

The president is right that it takes a great deal of time, money and energy to raise children. But why should politicians reward some family arrangements and penalize others?

Every family has to make its own tradeoffs when determining how to divide responsibilities inside and outside the home -- government shouldn't put its thumb on the scale one way or another. Rather, policy should strive to treat all such choices equally, giving every family -- regardless of its structure, income and values -- the flexibility to make the choices best for them.

That's the idea behind my own tax reform proposal, which would eliminate preferential tax benefits for this or that parental choice and replace all of those with a new tax credit of $2,500 per child. Under my plan, families would be eligible for the credit regardless of whether they had one income or two, or whether they used commercial day care or chose to have mom or dad stay home with the kids.

What each family did with the money would be up to them, not the government, as it should be.

Just as my plan wouldn't give preferential treatment to one kind of parent over another, it also wouldn't privilege parents over taxpayers without children. On the contrary, it's designed to correct the unfair over-taxation of parents in the current system.

Today, parents effectively pay into the senior entitlement programs twice: once through their payroll taxes and again in bearing the costs of raising their children -- the next generation of payroll taxpayers. An expanded child credit would not create a new distortion in the tax code, but correct an existing one.

In contrast, President Obama's plan would penalize those families -- including many in Utah -- that choose the breadwinner/homemaker model by narrowly tailoring the expanded tax credit to benefit only those parents who use commercial day care.

Rather than pitting different kinds of families against one another, real reform should guarantee all families an equal opportunity to pursue their happiness according to their own values and goals.

Some have said that President Obama's tax plan represents a missed opportunity for bipartisan compromise. I disagree. Having two different plans on the table doesn't signal the end of a failed negotiation, but the beginning of what could be a productive debate.

I'm glad the president recognizes that our tax code doesn't work for America's moms and dads, and I look forward to advancing reforms alongside anyone committed to fixing it for all families."
949810,Real Clear Policy - Update Privacy Laws for the Digital Age,9,"By Mike Lee and Patrick Leahy

Americans routinely are bombarded with news stories about invasive new surveillance technologies. But Congress has yet to pass even the most basic legislation on the issue: a bill to ensure that law-enforcement agents cannot read Americans' private e-mails without search warrants.

In the coming weeks, we will reintroduce legislation to update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and safeguard the privacy of e-mail and other information stored in ""the cloud."" In the last Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved this bipartisan bill, but it has yet to become law. Today is Data Privacy Day, reminding everyone of the work that needs to be done.

The Constitution guarantees ""the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."" But that guarantee is at risk when the government can search and seize vast troves of our private e-mails, texts, and social-media posts without our knowledge or consent -- and without a search warrant.

Almost 30 years ago, Congress enacted ECPA to protect the privacy of these communications. At that time, no one could have imagined how the Internet and mobile technologies would transform the way Americans communicate and exchange information. There was no World Wide Web, no cloud computing, and no social media -- much of the technology that we take for granted today. After three decades, it is time to update this law.

The proposal we will soon introduce requires the government to obtain a search warrant, based on probable cause, before searching through the content of Americans' e-mail or other electronic communications stored with a service provider such as Google, Facebook, or Yahoo!. The government is already prohibited from tapping our phones or forcibly entering our homes to obtain private information without warrants. The same privacy protections should apply to our online communications.

Our legislation will take into account privacy interests, law-enforcement needs, and the interests of our thriving American tech sector. In our global economy, American technology companies are competing internationally and need to rebuild consumer trust. And just like the bill that garnered broad support in the last Congress, our bill will include balanced exceptions to the warrant requirement to address emergency circumstances.

Support for ECPA reform continues to grow. We have been joined in the effort by senators from both sides of the aisle, and last year 273 members of the House of Representatives supported this legislation. A diverse coalition of more than 100 leaders in the privacy, civil-liberties, civil-rights, and technology communities, including Americans for Tax Reform, the ACLU, the Heritage Foundation, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and many major technology companies, also support our bill. 

Just last week, many of these organizations joined together to urge the Senate to pass ECPA reform. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, these organizations said that not only would ECPA legislation ""allow law enforcement officials to obtain electronic communications in all appropriate cases while protecting Americans' constitutional rights,"" but it also would ""provide certainty for American businesses developing innovative new services and competing in a global marketplace.""

Many Americans are frustrated that Congress seems more interested in partisan bickering than in getting things done. By working together, as a Democrat from Vermont and a Republican from Utah, we hope that all senators will join us to pass meaningful and bipartisan legislation that benefits all Americans. Congress should pass ECPA reform this year, and President Obama should sign these important privacy reforms into law."
949890,Tulsa World - U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin: Do-Nothing White House Out of Excuses on Keystone Pipeline,9,"Congress has made a unified effort to put the priorities of the American people ahead of the president's liberal agenda.

We sent a bill to the White House that means good-paying jobs and energy security. We passed the Keystone XL pipeline.

Final approval of this project means a reduced dependency on foreign oil, and real economic growth. It means shovel-ready jobs for many Americans which will be created using private sector dollars, not government funds.

But the do nothing White House has played into the hands of pocketbook environmentalist, threatening to veto this good government, bipartisan bill.
What's worse is the president has already issued 10 veto threats in less than 10 weeks. Bills that would help our veterans get jobs. Bills that would let hard-working Oklahomans keep their hours and wages. And bills that would protect the unborn.
So, instead of the president working with Congress -- as he promised to do -- we are only hearing more excuses and seeing more politically-motivated actions.

In a time when great strides are being made in the energy industry, it is frustrating to see production slowed by outdated laws and heavy-handed red tape. This is not what Americans asked for last November. And it is not what they expect from the leader of our nation.

Oklahoma has greatly benefited from the southern leg of this pipeline, which runs through the Second Congressional District. I was able to tour a portion of the southern leg while it was under construction and meet with workers -- including residents of my district -- who were happy to have the work constructing this pipeline. And I know that construction of the northern leg will provide similar opportunities.

However, the approval of this energy and job-creating project is about something bigger.

This project is a major part of updating our nation's energy infrastructure. By doing so, we can maintain low and reliable energy costs--giving our economy the boost it needs. For working families, this means lower utility bills and gas prices, which puts more food on the kitchen table.

So the president has a choice. Stand with America's families for good energy jobs and lower bills. Or stand with his fringe environmentalists, blocking a project that his own State Department says will create jobs.

His excuses have run out and it is time for him to be accountable to the American people for his decision.

I stand with the rest of America in putting jobs and economy first. And I will continue to send bipartisan bills to the president's desk, forcing the White House to explain why the Obama administration continues to reject moving America's economy forward.

As the fight for our values continues, I will urge the president to put politics aside and rethink his veto threats. A united Congress is working on your behalf to get this country back on track. It is long overdue for the president to get on board or explain why he is standing in the way of better jobs and more opportunities."
949914,Daily Signal - How to Put Parents Back in Control of Their Child's Education,9,"By Mike Lee

A good primary and secondary education is the cornerstone of the American Dream: it prepares us for economic and personal success and facilitates our pursuit of happiness.

But too often the history of America's public school system has been a story of dashed hopes, deferred dreams, and unfulfilled promises. Hopes of parents--that the local school system would prepare their kids to climb higher than they ever could. Dreams of students--that their teachers would inspire and believe in them. And promises of policymakers--that more money would fix a fundamentally broken system.

Millions of low-income families who are stuck in underperforming schools have no way out and no way to choose something better.

These families are not just let down by our nation's dysfunctional education policy--they are trapped by it.

Providing a solid education for the next generation is, as Abraham Lincoln once wrote, ""the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in.""

Policymakers should aim, as he did, ""to see the time when education, and by its means, morality, society, enterprise and industry, shall become much more general than at present.""

That's why I recently introduced in the Senate a bill that would empower the people most acutely committed to the quality of our education system: America's moms and dads. My colleague on the other side of the Capitol, Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., has introduced a companion bill in the House.

By giving parents more power to invest in their child's education and to choose what school best meets their needs, the Enhancing Educational Opportunities for All Act takes an important step toward restoring accountability to our public education system--something that has been missing for far too long.

Under our current system--which has remained essentially unchanged since President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act--most parents are powerless to influence the quality of their child's education.

What occurs in public school classrooms around the country--what teachers teach and how they teach it--is the result of a long, convoluted, bureaucratic chain of command that zigzags its way from Washington to local school districts, but never includes parents.

First, Congress passes legislation authorizing federal bureaucrats to establish rules, regulations, and standards with which states must comply in order to receive federal education funds.

Next, state officials refine--or in some cases distort--these Washington directives, writing narrower rules for their school districts, which then establish the specific policies for individual schools.

At no point in this decision-making process are parents consulted.

Instead, they are left with a ""take it or leave it"" choice: either accept the education offered at the local public school--no matter how bad it may be--or buy a better alternative, by moving closer to a better school or paying private school tuition.

For America's most affluent families, this is no big deal--they can afford private schools and so have the power to choose the school that is best for their children. For everyone else, it precludes parents from making choices about their children's education.

So our bill would expand school choice to all parents, regardless of socio-economic status or zip code, by allowing federal ""Title I"" K-12 support funds to follow low-income students to any public or private school of their choice.

It would also remove the contribution limits on Coverdell education savings accounts and allow ""529"" account funds to cover K-12 education expenses.

Our bill would give working parents more opportunities to invest in a variety of learning services and products outside the classroom, such as tutoring, online courses and textbooks.

The problem facing our public school system today is not about a lack of money--we have nearly tripled our investments in elementary and secondary students since 1970. The problem is dysfunctional government policy--however well intentioned--and a lack of accountability.

And that's exactly what we should expect when Washington bureaucrats have more control than parents over a child's education. We have a moral and economic obligation to flip this equation and put parents back in the driver's seat.

For when we tolerate a system in which the quality of a child's education depends on her parents' zip code, we fail to live up to the ideals at the heart of American exceptionalism.

And when millions of children learn from a young age not to dream big, but to surrender to the hopelessness of low expectations, we will live in a society where upward mobility is no longer rule but the exception.

We can and we must do better."
949915,Breitbart - Rand Paul's Response to Obama's 2015 State of the Union Address,9,"Good Evening. I wish I had better news for you, but All is not well in America. America is adrift. Something is clearly wrong.

America needs many things, but what America desperately needs is new leadership.

I've only been in office a short time, but one thing I've discovered is that there is no monopoly on knowledge in Washington.

The best thing that could happen is for us--to once and for all--limit the terms of all politicians. We already limit the President to two terms.

I think we should put limits on the terms of Congress and infuse our government with fresh ideas.

Before I ran for office, I practiced medicine for nearly 20 years in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Liberal elites fly over my small town, but they don't understand us. They simply seek to impose their will upon us--from what insurance we can buy, to what light bulbs we can use, to how we generate electricity.

Most of us in flyover country, and I suspect many who live in our big cities, think those in government take us for granted. Those of us who are actively pursuing the American Dream simply want government to get out of our way.

For those of us who feel separated and distant from the American Dream, we don't want be perpetually talked down to, forgotten, and left in perpetual poverty. Many are discouraged that the ""gifts"" offered by liberals have not generated wealth, but rather perpetuated poverty.

People want a way out--not fake concern and baubles.

The war on poverty is 50 years old, and still black unemployment is twice that of white unemployment.

Income inequality has worsened under this Administration, and tonight President Obama offers more of the same policies--policies that have allowed the poor to get poorer, and the rich to get richer.

Pitting one American against another is not a pathway towards prosperity.

The President is intent on redistributing the pie but not growing it. He misunderstands that the bulk of America wants a bigger pie. They want to work and don't want a handout--but a hand up.

Not only do we need new blood in Washington, we need a new way of thinking in Washington.

As a physician, I was taught first to do no harm:

To think before you act,

To analyze the unintended consequences of your actions.

I think America would be better off if all our politicians took that same approach: ""First, do no harm.""

It is self-evident that the President and Congress are unable to do what every family in America must do--balance the budget.

If Congress cannot, or will not, balance the budget, then we should amend the Constitution to make it mandatory. President Obama is on course to add more to our national debt than all previous presidents combined. We borrow a million dollars a minute. Our $18 trillion dollar debt has become an anchor. Some economists argue that the burden of debt costs us a million jobs a year.

I fear that this enormous burden of debt threatens our currency. I fear that another 2008-style panic is possible, and I fear that this degree of debt is an imminent threat to our national security.

You cannot project power from bankruptcy court. It does not make us appear stronger when we borrow money from China and send it to countries that burn our flag. The hollowing out of our national defense comes from the advocates for unlimited spending and perpetual military intervention.

Secretary Gates got it right when he said that we've over-militarized our foreign policy. Should we be engaged in trying to encourage stability in the world? Absolutely. But we must think before we act. We must remember the maxim--first, do no harm.

Hillary's war in Libya is a prime example of acting without thinking. Libya is now a jihadist wonderland. Jihadists swim in our embassy pool. Our Ambassador is dead, and we are now more at risk from terrorist attacks than ever before.

Unfortunately, both parties too often seek military intervention without thinking through the possible unintended consequences. Many Republicans only complain that we didn't send U.S. ground troops or we didn't stay long enough.

The Middle East lives in the midst of a 1,000-year war between Sunni and Shia. Superimposed on the long war is a century-old war pitting a barbaric aberration of Islam against civilized Islam.

We are foolish to believe we will solve this puzzle. We must defend ourselves and defend vital American interests, but we must not be deluded into believing that we can remake the Middle East in an image of Western Democracy.

At home, much of nation still suffers.

Dr. Martin Luther King spoke of two Americas. He described them as ""two starkly different American experiences that exist side by side.""

In one America, people experienced ""the opportunity of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in all its dimensions.""

In the other America, people experienced a ""daily ugliness"" that dashes hope and leaves only ""the fatigue of despair.""

Although I was born into the America that experiences and believes in opportunity, my trips to Ferguson, Detroit, Atlanta, and Chicago have revealed what I call an ""undercurrent of unease.""

There is a tension that has become visible in the protests in every major American city. As Congressman John Lewis put it: ""There is a growing discontent in this country. ""

I think peace will come when those of us who have enjoyed the American Dream become aware of those who are missing out on the American Dream. The future of our country will be secure when we break down the wall that separates us from ""the other America.""

It is a noble aspiration and a moral obligation to make sure our fellow man is provided for, that medical treatment is made available to all.

But compassion cannot be delivered in the form of coercion.

President Obama's fundamental promise that if you like your doctor you can keep them--was a lie.

Obamacare, at its core, takes away a patient's right to choose. Under Obamacare, patients are prohibited from choosing their doctor or their insurance.

Today, more Americans may have medical insurance, but Americans are now paying more money for worse care.

The relationship between doctor and patient is withering.

Doctors are fleeing the profession they love. Hospitals are straining, closing, or refusing to accept Obamacare policies.

Everyone knows our health care system needed reforming, but it was the wrong prescription to choose more government instead of more consumer choice and competition.

Obamacare restricts freedom and must be repealed!

I was asked recently how we would fix our healthcare system. I replied, ""Let's try freedom again. It worked for over 200 years!""

The President tonight calls for higher taxes. I believe we should do the opposite. I propose we cut everyone's taxes, from the richest to poorest, and we cut spending at the same time.

Imagine a private stimulus fed by allowing you to keep more of your own money!

Some will ask, ""But what of the safety net?""

I say: We will not cut one penny from the safety net until we've cut every penny from corporate welfare!

So much of Washington's inability to cut waste in government comes from them not doing their job. It has been several decades since Congress passed all the spending bills individually.

Instead, the spending bills are lumped together in something they call a ""Cromnibus"" that is thousands of pages long. They allow no amendments to cut wasteful spending. Often the bill is plopped on our desk with only a few hours to review. No one, and I mean no one, is able to read what is in the bill.

To fix this, I will introduce legislation called ""Read the Bills Act."" It mandates that Congress wait one day for each 20 pages of legislation.

Congress should also live under the laws they pass.

I will introduce a Constitutional Amendment that Congress shall pass no law that exempts Congress from the requirements of the bill.

We have set up a privileged class in Washington, and Americans are sick and tired of it.

These elites say, ""trust us, we won't violate your privacy.""

But when the Intelligence Director is not punished for lying to Congress, how are we to trust them?

Are we to trust them to collect and hold every American's phone records?

Remember, these are the same people who have only a 10 percent approval rating!

The Constitution is clear. Politicians should NOT collect this information without a warrant. Warrants must be specific to an individual and there must be probable cause before government is allowed to search any American's documents.

The President created this vast dragnet by Executive Order without Congressional authority. He should immediately end this invasion of our privacy.

We need to return to our founding principles and stand up for the entire Bill of Rights.

To defend the Bill of Rights, we must have a strong national defense. I believe national defense is the single most important, Constitutional obligation of our Federal Government.

We should have a military that is second to none in the world, and ready to defend us from all enemies.

To defend ourselves, we need a lean, mean fighting machine that doesn't waste money on a bloated civilian bureaucracy.

The civilian bureaucracy at the Pentagon has doubled in the past 30 years, gobbling up the money necessary to modernize our defense.

That's why I will propose the first ever Audit of the Pentagon, and seek ways to make our defense department more modern and efficient.

Without leadership, our country is adrift -- yet there is still much promise for the future of America.

Our future can include a road back to prosperity back to respect at home and abroad.

It can include a balanced budget and a simple, fair tax system.

It can include a government that protects your rights and your security.

It can include a Congress that is responsive to YOU, the people, and not the special interests.

It can include a stronger, better military, where our troops and veterans are valued and taken care of.

It can include a plan to bring prosperity to our inner cities, and real justice to all Americans.

The path we are on now does not lead there. But there is time to change course.

This President tonight, and for the past six years, has had the wrong diagnosis for what ails our country.

I look forward to having a conversation with the American people about this throughout this next year.

Thank you, and God Bless America."
949922,Washington Times - Yemen's Collapse Demonstrates Obama's Foreign Policy Failures,9,"By Ted Cruz

Last Tuesday night, President Obama assured the American people that their nation is secure because of his leadership. His ""steady, persistent resolve,"" Mr. Obama proclaimed in his State of the Union speech, has resulted in a ""safer, more prosperous world.""

Mr. Obama's soothing words stand in stark contrast with the violent results of his foreign policy playing out halfway around the globe in the nation of Yemen. Despite an American-brokered cease-fire last September, Shiite Houthi rebels control the northern part of the country supported by their Iranian sponsors, who want to control the strategically important entrance to the Red Sea. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), widely recognized as one of the most vicious Sunni terrorist organizations in the world, controls large parts of the country. Attracted by the general lawlessness, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is sending operatives to join in the mayhem. The existing government has resigned en masse. The country has become a magnet for bad actors of all descriptions and the United States has little if any control over events as they fight among themselves.

Americans might be forgiven for wondering why we should be concerned about events in this distant and impoverished country, but Yemen demands our attention as the terrorism bred there has global reach. The USS Cole was attacked in the Yemeni port of Aden in 2000, and the so-called ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up a commercial airliner over Detroit in 2009, was trained there. The radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who instructed Fort Hood attacker Nidal Hasan in jihad was killed in a drone strike on the Yemeni province of al-Jawf in 2011. Seventy-one of the 122 prisoners remaining at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility are from Yemen.

The Obama administration, however, has refused to recognize the dangerous reality that is Yemen, and has instead embarked on a campaign of outreach that has until recently been touted as a hallmark of its achievements on the international stage.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Sanaa in January 2011 and announced that U.S. policy was to develop a ""unified, stable, democratic and prosperous Yemen where civil society has room to operate but al Qaeda does not."" American aid subsequently doubled in what Mrs. Clinton called a ""rebalancing"" of priorities.

Mr. Obama has repeatedly insisted this policy has been a great success. Last June, for example, the president praised Yemeni President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi as a ""committed partner"" to the United States, and boasted ""we have been able to develop their capacities without putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground at the same time as we've got enough counterterrorism capabilities."" Yemen should become, the president said, a ""model"" for trouble spots like Syria and Iraq because of the ""wide-ranging national dialogue that took a long time, but helped give people a sense that there is a legitimate political outlet for grievances."" Just four months ago, the president informed the American people that our strategy against ISIS in Iraq would be the exactly same as the one ""we have successfully pursued in Yemen for years.""

But the reality is that four years and a billion American taxpayer dollars after Mrs. Clinton's visit, Yemen is spiraling into chaos.

The collapse of Yemen is, unfortunately, not an isolated event -- it is representative of the larger failures of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. Convinced that they possessed unique insight into the global community, the administration has tried to manage the threat of radical Islamic terrorism with drone strikes, foreign aid and vague promises of ""political reconciliation"" to heal the 14-centuries-old divisions between Sunni and Shiite.

In Yemen, as in so many places around the globe, however, this approach has left the United States with few good options and with our influence in shambles. We need to face the reality that Yemen is being torn apart by two sworn enemies of America and our first priority should be to secure any remaining U.S. personnel in the country. We must then explore how to defend our strategic interests in the region without benefiting either Iran or al Qaeda.

The clear lesson of Yemen is that, rather than a magic formula for world peace, the Obama foreign policy has proven a recipe for disaster. The State of the Union speech demonstrated that the president refuses to learn this lesson. He is doubling down on the policies that have so demonstrably failed over the past six years.

The members of the new 114th Congress owe it to the American people to do everything we can to mitigate the damage the president is doing to our national security. As the recent violent attacks in Paris by radical Islamic terrorists trained by AQAP in Yemen demonstrate, the consequences of the president's policies are not confined to faraway lands. They directly threaten America and our allies. This week, therefore, I refiled the Expatriate Terrorist Act, which prevents American citizens who have fought abroad for designated terrorists groups like AQAP and ISIS from returning to the United States. I am grateful for the support of my colleagues for this legislation, and look forward to working with senators on both sides of the aisle on additional measures to secure our nation.

As John Adams observed in 1770, ""facts are stubborn things,"" the president's platitudes about the success of his policies in the State of the Union notwithstanding. The fact is these policies have failed -- and the fact is we cannot afford additional fiascoes like Yemen over the last two years of the Obama administration."
949930,Daily Herald - A Fresh Opportunity on Health Care Reform,9,"By Mike Lee

Many people in Utah County are concerned about the cost and quality of their health care. As the Affordable Care Act slowly comes into effect, individuals, families, and businesses across the county are seeing firsthand how the law that was supposed to reform our health system has only multiplied problems that had been building for years.

I recently received an email from Alex, a full-time graduate student in Provo, who is, as he put it, ""beyond frustrated"" that the costs of health insurance keep rising while the number of options available keeps shrinking.

Like so many others in Utah County, the Affordable Care Act has left Alex stuck with no good choices.

He was forced to cancel his old plan when the rates quadrupled last year, but he was denied access to Medicaid and deemed ineligible for a tax subsidy because he is unmarried, without kids, and studying full-time with no source of income.

Now, the cheapest plan available to him costs $180 a month and comes with a whopping $6000 deductible -- which is anything but ""affordable"" on a graduate student's budget.

Alex deserves better from his government. The people of Utah deserve better. And that's why I'm committed to achieving real reform to our dysfunctional health system.

Today, the chances of such reform are better than ever.

The new, unified Congress recently sworn into office has a unique opportunity to advance legislation that empowers patients and families -- not distant, coercive bureaucracies -- to decide how they want to spend their health care dollars.

There are several thoughtful, conservative leaders in Congress who have developed reform plans that would expand choices, improve quality, and lower costs, thereby making health insurance and health care more accessible and more affordable.

And here in Utah, state legislators recognize the need to advance fair and sustainable reforms. Representative Dean Sanpei, who represents the Provo area, spoke for many when he said, ""The Medicaid program nationally has unsustainable cost trajectories and is in critical need of real reforms, not just expansion.""

But getting these legislative ideas passed and signed into law ultimately depends on the continued engagement of people like Alex and countless other Utahns who call and write their elected representatives every day. These are men and women who refuse to let their frustration and disappointment with the government turn into indifference toward the government.

Ours is still a government of, by, and for the people, and I'm glad that the honest, hardworking people of Utah never relent in making their voices heard."
950029,"Politico Magazine - No, the GOP is not at War with Science",9,"By Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Lamar Smith

Since our founding, America's economic strength and national security have depended on scientists and innovators to promote growth and prosperity. Both public and private investments in research and development fuel the economy, create jobs and lead to new technologies that benefit Americans' daily lives.

But to remain a world leader, the United States must ensure that our investments are funding not just any science but the best science.

Our national debt is more than $18 trillion, and the American taxpayer is hurting. If we, as a country, have decided to spend taxpayers' hard-earned dollars on funding science and research, then we need to spend wisely. Every dollar spent by the federal government must be spent just as the typical family deals with spending decisions on car payments, child care, food purchases and housing needs.

So how do U.S. research agencies decide what types of research are deserving of limited federal funds? And how do we assure hardworking American families that their tax dollars are being spent only on the highest priority research that is in the national interest? Unfortunately, in recent years, the federal government has awarded taxpayer dollars toward research that few Americans would consider to be in the national interest.

For example, it is Congress' constitutional responsibility to ask questions when the National Science Foundation decides to spend public funds on a climate change-themed musical ($700,000) or an investigation of tea party activity on social media ($919,000) or to study bicycle designs ($300,000). Other examples of questionable grants funded by the NSF include:

Ancient Icelandic textile industry: $487,049

Eco consequences of early human-set fires in New Zealand: $339,958

History of Chiapas, Mexico (350 B.C.-A.D. 1350): $280,558

Mayan architecture and the salt industry: $233,141

Do Turkish women wear veils because they are fashionable?: $199,088

How local Asian Indian politicians can improve their performance: $425,000

Lawsuits in Peru from 1600-1700: $50,000

Similarly, the National Institutes of Health has engaged in the funding of wasteful projects like $258,000 on a website for the first lady's White House garden.

These programs might sound merely frivolous, but the problem is that when the NSF or NIH funds projects of these kinds, there is less money to support good scientific research that can yield technological breakthroughs and opportunities for economic growth. Ebola-related scientific research is something that Americans want to prioritize, yet this important research is competing with wasteful grants.

Unfortunately, the academic community and the media vilify any attempt by Congress to better understand the grant-award process, labeling it political interference and an attack on science. POLITICO recently published an article describing Republicans' questioning of how agencies such as the NSF and NIH prioritize research spending as the ""next battle in the war on science."" But scrutinizing science funding isn't the same as attacking science.

There's a reason Congress demands answers and accountability from our federal science agencies: to make our nation's scientific research enterprise stronger and more helpful to our nation. The academic community forgets that federal science funding should be in the national interest. Scientific breakthroughs can cure diseases, create millions of jobs and transform society. Interdisciplinary research to understand how the brain works could lead to cures for dementia and Parkinson's disease, as well as advances in treating traumatic injury and combat wounds. Research to advance development of quantum computers could lead to the next generation of fast computers.

The first step toward eliminating wasteful spending should be increased transparency. At the moment, the only information available to the public about grants is a brief summary on the agency's website written by the researcher. Instead, agencies -- not researchers -- should provide a plain-English, nontechnical explanation of why taxpayer-funded grants are important or have the potential to benefit the national interest. Once the process is more open and transparent, it will be easier to redirect public research investments to the areas that boost economic growth and job creation: biology, computer science, mathematics and engineering.

Congress has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and are focused on national priorities. In the new Congress, Republicans, the party of limited government, should propose legislation to eliminate the funding of wasteful projects--and focus on smart investments instead."
950034,TIME - Sen. Rand Paul: Break Down the Wall that Separates Us from the 'Other America',9,"In his 1967 address to Stanford University, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke of two Americas. He described them as, ""two starkly different American experiences that exist side by side.""

In one America, people experienced ""the opportunity of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in all its dimensions."" In the other America, people experienced a ""daily ugliness"" that dashes hope and leaves only ""the fatigue of despair.""

The uneasy coexistence of the two Americas is brought to bear by the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown.

Although I was born into the America that experiences and believes in opportunity, my trips to Ferguson, Detroit, Atlanta, and Chicago have revealed that there is an undercurrent of unease.
 
Congressman John Lewis, who heroically marched in Selma, still sees two Americas. He writes: ""One group of people in this country can expect the institutions of government to bend in their favor, no matter that they are supposedly regulated by impartial law.""

The other group: ""[C]hildren, fathers, mothers, uncles, grandfathers . . . are swept up like rubbish by the hard unforgiving hand of the law. They are offered no lenience, even for petty offenses, in a system that seems hell-bent on warehousing them by the millions . . . while others escape the consequences of pervasive malfeasance scot-free.""

We need to notice and be aware of the injustices embedded in our criminal system. However, we shouldn't be misled to believe that excessive force is the norm, not the exception. I believe that most police are conscientious and want only to provide safety for us.

The blame should be directed to the laws and the politicians who order police into untenable positions, that insist on ""taking down"" someone for selling a couple of untaxed cigarettes.

Our pursuit of justice should not obscure the fact that on many occasions, good people do step forward to find justice.

This past fall, Helen Johnson was desperate to feed her two daughters and their small children who had gone two days without food. When she got to the store, she discovered that the $1.25 she had was not enough to buy eggs. She was a mere fifty cents short, so she stuffed the eggs in her pocket.

Helen didn't even make it out of the store before the police were notified.

When Police Officer William Stacy arrived, something special happened. Instead of handcuffing Helen and taking her to jail, he used discretion and compassion to mete out justice. He warned Helen not to steal again and he bought her the eggs himself. Helen saw Officer Stacy again on Thanksgiving Day. He delivered a truckload of groceries to Helen's home. Her grandchildren were overjoyed and proclaimed that they had never seen so much food in all their lives.

It isn't hard to find injustice around us, but we must not let injustice smear the good deeds that do occur everyday.

I am optimistic, but peace will only come when those of us who have enjoyed the American Dream become more aware of those who are missing out on the Dream.

The future of our country will be secure when we break down the wall that separates us from ""the other America.""

Let's commemorate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King by uniting the two Americas into one: an America that includes justice for one, and justice for all."
950037,CNN - How Feds Can Legally Steal Your Money,9,"By Rand Paul and Tim Walberg

There are many reasons why the Internal Revenue Service is perhaps the least-loved agency in America -- a tax code so complex that it seems like you need an advanced degree to understand it, the dreaded audit process and revelations that certain groups have been targeted based on their political beliefs.

And now, a growing awareness of instances where the IRS seized the money or property of law-abiding citizens without due process is adding to the agency's menacing reputation. According to the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that investigates civil forfeiture practices, these seizures carried out by the IRS had increased from 114 in 2005 to 639 in 2012.

Sounds unbelievable, but believe it.

Under a federal structuring statute, banks are required to report all cash deposits of more than $10,000 to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury. To prevent money laundering, deposits purposely ""structured"" to evade this reporting are illegal. Enter the IRS.

In Michigan, the IRS suspected a local grocer, Terry Dehko, of money laundering. Without filing charges, it seized his $35,000 bank account. Dehko had to prove in court that his daily bank deposits were for insurance reasons and to reduce robbery at his store -- not a criminal enterprise. Fortunately, the Dehkos won their case, and the IRS returned their funds.

Iowa native Carole Hinders has made an honest living owning and operating a restaurant, Mrs. Lady's, for 38 years. But in August 2013, everything she saved -- roughly $33,000 -- was seized. The IRS targeted Hinders because her restaurant only accepted cash or checks, which made regular bank deposits necessary. After 19 months and extensive national media exposure, Hinders finally got her money back.

In Maryland, the IRS used suspicions of structuring to seize the operating accounts of locally owned South Mountain Creamery and forced owners Randy and Karen Sowers to prove their innocence. Fortunately, the Sowers settled their case by showing their deposits were legitimate but only after expending extensive time and energy.

Recent announcements by the Justice and Treasury departments that they will end most forms of equitable sharing -- the practice of federal law enforcement coordinating with local and state law enforcement for the purpose of pursuing civil asset forfeiture cases -- are a start, but this only affects a fraction of overall seizures.

In addition to the IRS, the Department of Justice and U.S. attorney's offices across the country have civil asset forfeiture authority. In fact, the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York, run by Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch, has been an active seizure office.

A disturbing example under her watch is the Bi-County Distributors case, where her prosecutors confiscated $446,651 from a small business run by Jeffrey, Richard and Mitch Hirsch. It took Lynch two years finally to drop the charges. In light of this case and her office's extensive practice of civil forfeiture -- more than 120 times during her tenure -- it was disappointing to hear her defend the current system during Wednesday's confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Beyond these specific examples of abuse, Congress must take a hard look at the underlying federal civil asset forfeiture policies.

Ultimately, the Equitable Sharing Program must be eliminated through legislative action as part of a larger package of reforms to the entire practice of civil asset forfeiture.

For this reason, we have combined our previous efforts to introduce the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act, or FAIR Act, in both the House of Representatives and Senate. It would bolster protections for property and property owners by raising the level of proof necessary for the federal government to prove a civil asset forfeiture case -- requiring that the IRS and Department of Justice prove guilt, rather than the individual prove innocence.

Moreover, the FAIR Act eliminates incentives for civil forfeiture by rerouting funds seized by the IRS to the general treasury rather than the unaccountable Asset Forfeiture Fund, which has little congressional oversight and has grown since its inception in 1986 to more than $2 billion in 2013. This fund is the depository for all forfeiture dollars seized by the IRS, Justice Department and equitable sharing partners -- such as local police forces -- at the state and local level.

Lastly, the FAIR Act inserts protections by mandating the IRS prove individuals have knowingly violated the structuring statute instead of simply inferring guilt from the deposits themselves. Making cash deposits does not automatically put you under suspicion of criminal activity.

The FAIR Act will ensure that federal government agencies, like the IRS and Department of Justice, no longer profit from taking the property of U.S. citizens without due process, while maintaining the ability of courts to order the surrender of proceeds of crime.

The FAIR Act intends to tilt the playing field back in favor of due process and property rights. We call on our colleagues in Congress to address this issue and join our efforts."
950039,Bowling Green Daily News - Right-to-Work is Really About Worker Freedom,9,"By Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul

Union membership may be in decline across America, but here in the Bluegrass State, unions still have the power to force workers into becoming dues-paying members against their will. That means if you work for an employer who contracts with a union, you can be forced to pay union dues as a condition of employment.

That's outrageous. It's long past time Kentucky follow the lead of 24 other states and pass right-to-work legislation. Right-to-work laws are simple enough. They empower employees to decide on their own terms whether they prefer to spend their hard-earned money on joining a union, or if they would prefer to take that money home.

Right-to-work legislation is a smart policy that boosts economic development while advancing workers' rights by ensuring workers are not forced to join, and thus aren't limited by the dictates of a union.

We support right-to-work laws at every level of government -- federal, state, and local. We've joined together to push for national right-to-work legislation in the U.S. Senate in the past. Just this week, we again introduced the National Right to Work Act. And we see great benefits for Kentucky to pass a state right-to-work law. We were pleased to see the Kentucky Senate pass one, and we encourage the Kentucky House to take up and pass this pro-worker reform.

Local jurisdictions throughout the commonwealth are fed up with waiting for a state or federal law that will provide them with the safety net from big labor they need. That's why we support Warren County's recent move to pass its own right-to-work legislation. Other Kentucky counties, including Simpson, Fulton, Todd and Hardin, have followed Warren County's lead to stay competitive. Local jurisdictions should do everything they can to increase their own competitiveness, which is why we applaud other counties in Kentucky following in their footsteps.

Warren County, like the rest of Kentucky, must compete for employers with neighboring states, many of which, like Tennessee and Indiana, have already passed right-to-work laws. Without a similar incentive, Kentucky will lose out in the race to attract businesses that create jobs in our communities. It's no accident that manufacturing employment is one-third higher in states that embrace these policies, and that nine of the top 10 states for business and jobs in America are all right-to-work states.

Until big labor's grip on workers and employers is loosened, Kentucky will keep falling behind its neighbors that have right-to-work laws. Over the past decade, growth in private-sector jobs in right-to-work states was 15.3 percent; in Kentucky it was only 6.9 percent. You might think that forced union membership would at least bring with it higher pay, but you'd be wrong: Compensation in right-to-work states grew at a rate of 14.2 percent, while in Kentucky it was only 4.3 percent.

At its core, the right-to-work is really about worker freedom. One survey showed that 80 percent of union members said employees shouldn't be forced or coerced into joining a union. No one should be forced to join a union they believe fails to represent their personal interests.

Five counties in Kentucky have passed ordinances to ensure this protection is extended to workers in their jurisdictions. We support them and hope that other counties as well as the state legislature will soon follow suit."
950202,Shreveport Times - Camp Minden Burn Needs Greater EPA Assurance,9,"By Sen. David Vitter and Rep. John Fleming

It's long past time for the Environmental Protection Agency, along with Louisiana state government and the military, to dispose of the explosives abandoned at Camp Minden. Those dangerous, improperly stored explosives have been a source of safety and public health risks in northwest Louisiana for over two years.

But there are legitimate questions and concerns about the EPA's current plan to dispose of the explosives through an open burn. We need confidence that this strategy will be safe, and the EPA's verbal pledges are simply not enough.

We are asking the EPA and its state colleagues to present clear, scientific data before they burn any explosives. Folks in the surrounding areas deserve to understand the agency's decision to use the open burn process, see any data the EPA has collected about this method, and know the steps and procedures that will be used to protect public safety throughout the disposal process.

We need to get this information as soon as possible. According to the Army, the danger of an explosion grows much more starting this August, when the explosives will be capable of self-detonating. However, we can't allow that threat to rush us into costly long-term mistakes. Replacing one fear with another is not fair to folks in northwest Louisiana.

So far, the EPA has failed to live up to its promised level of communication and openness. We have written to EPA's Region 6 Administrator with specific questions about this matter. We will continue to press for immediate responses that demonstrate the EPA is taking responsibility for a safe outcome of the explosives disposal. We are also working with state and local officials and listening carefully to constituent concerns.

Our top priority is to fully protect the safety of the residents near Camp Minden and across north Louisiana. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our offices at (318) 861-0437 (Sen. Vitter), and (318) 798-2254 (Rep. Fleming)."
950309,Real Clear Politics - A Healthy Economy for All,9,"By Representative Tom Price

President Obama calls higher taxes, more bureaucracy and Washington spending ""middle class economics."" Yet it's those economic policies that have created a recovery that's been particularly lousy for America's middle class.
 
Wages have stagnated; median income is down and GDP growth is worse than any recovery in the modern era. According to the most recent data available from the Federal Reserve, real median household income for the middle fifth of families has fallen by 6 percent since 2010. At the same time, the top ten percent of families have seen their real median household income increase by 2 percent.
 
The American Enterprise Institute's Arthur Brooks calls this an ""asymmetrical recovery."" Under President Obama, it is called the new normal. The middle class is getting left out of the nation's economic recovery.
 
The president can talk all day about ""shared prosperity,"" but after he and his allies in Congress spent years constructing barriers to economic opportunity -- that they are now feverishly promoting and protecting -- you get these unhealthy results. When you put in place a program like Obamacare -- which, in addition to harming access to quality health care, takes power out of the hands of individuals, families and entrepreneurs and puts it in the hands of Washington -- you make it harder and more costly for job creators to grow jobs and increase wages. When you block the exploration and production of energy resources, American workers lose out on jobs and energy security. When the president proposes once again to raise taxes to ensure the wealthy ""pay their fair share"" you get a scenario where everyone else ends up paying the price; including small businesses that often file as individuals instead of corporations.
 
While it may come as a surprise to those in the White House, higher taxes, needless regulations, and an overcharged, inefficient Washington bureaucracy are all barriers to growth and opportunity.
 
If what the president is proactively doing were not harmful enough, what he's refusing to do is far worse. President Obama's unwillingness or inability to address our looming debt crisis harms today's working families and will be particularly painful for the next generation as well. On our current course, America is going to rack up $5.2 trillion alone in interest payments on the debt in the next ten years. If we allotted those payments to taxpayers, it would be $300 more per month out of the pockets of hard-working folks. That is money that cannot be used to support health care, transportation, education or a strong national defense. It is just another burden on millions of Americans already struggling to get by.
 
President Obama and his Democrat allies will claim they want to do something about the nation's fiscal challenges by taking more money out of the pockets of families and businesses. But, like so many other grand schemes from this administration, the math just does not add up. Even if Washington were to tax every single dollar of every single millionaire in the country, it would generate roughly $1.3 trillion in revenue -- or enough to fund the government for about four months out of the year.
 
A failure to address our debt challenges with a serious, realistic and long-term reform plan means the nation's fiscal and economic well-being will only get worse.
 
Republicans are not willing to let our nation be condemned to this future. That is why we are focused on solutions that will increase economic opportunity and create a healthy economy to help benefit all Americans.
 
Our opportunity agenda says that policymakers ought to embrace the can-do attitude of American workers and the creative spirit of entrepreneurs and innovators. That means getting the debt under control by putting forward a balanced budget that allocates tax dollars more effectively and efficiently. It means strengthening and securing vital health and retirement programs that benefit millions of Americans but also represent the overwhelming majority of government spending. It's reckless and irresponsible to ignore the fact that these programs are on an unsustainable path.
 
At the same time, we need to reform the tax code so it is simpler and fairer, while streamlining regulations so that Washington stops trying to run our lives and instead focuses on its core responsibilities.
 
These actions will build the foundation for long-term prosperity, strengthen our communities and enhance the quality of life for more American families. They will empower individuals and build a healthy economy that encourages and rewards innovation, entrepreneurship, optimism, and creativity. With more jobs and increased wages, it will be easier to address our debt challenges, and in the long-term, we will have a healthier economy.
 
That's not just good for one group of Americans. That's good for every American."
950338,The Washington Post - Elizabeth Warren: Supreme Court Housing Decision Could Put Our Financial Well-Being at Risk,9,"The Supreme Court appears poised to continue its systematic assault on our core civil rights laws. After gutting the Voting Rights Act just two years ago, the court set its sights on our country's fair housing laws when it heard oral arguments today in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project. As with the voting rights decision, a decision limiting the scope of the housing laws would ignore the will of Congress and undermine basic principles of racial equality. But there is even more at stake in the fair housing case, because the wrong decision would reduce economic opportunities for working families and raise the risk of another financial crisis.

In 1968, Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act to combat segregation in housing. Congress drafted the act to give families two options to challenge discrimination: a claim that someone intentionally discriminated against them on the basis of race and a separate claim that someone adopted a policy or practice that had a disparate discriminatory impact on minority families.

Intentional discrimination cases are notoriously hard to prove because they require evidence of a person's state of mind. As a result, most housing segregation cases are brought on the second basis: disparate impact. Those cases are no easy lift either. To find a disparate-impact violation, a court must conclude that a challenged practice has a disproportionately negative effect on otherwise similar racial groups and that there is no nondiscriminatory explanation for the practice. Despite that high bar, disparate-impact claims have been the main tool for attacking some of the most persistent practices contributing to housing segregation.

Congress clearly intended to create two paths to challenge housing discrimination. For the past 47 years, appellate courts across the country have uniformly upheld the existence of Fair Housing Act disparate-impact claims. When it amended the law in 1988, Congress did nothing to question that settled understanding. In fact, with overwhelming majorities in both houses, it made the opposite decision, expanding the act to cover additional types of claims. Yet experienced watchers of the Supreme Court believe it is ready to defy Congress and ignore the country's appellate courts by eliminating the disparate-impact test altogether.

Such a ruling would inevitably result in far more segregated communities. Seventeen states, with both Democratic and Republican governors -- from Massachusetts and California to North Carolina and Utah -- have joined to warn that jettisoning disparate-impact claims would eliminate ""an especially important tool to combat the kinds of discrimination that perpetuate segregation."" That is deeply troubling on its face, but the economic effects are even broader.

Housing segregation has a powerful impact on opportunities to build economic security. Data show that lower- and middle-income families living in more segregated communities have a harder time climbing the economic ladder. A group of researchers from Harvard University and the University of California at Berkeley studied cities across the United States to assess what factors helped those in the lowest income bracket reach the highest income bracket later in life. They concluded that a lower level of housing segregation was one of only five factors consistently associated with upward mobility. Increasing segregation would just add to the troubles facing today's middle class.

Undercutting our fair housing laws also would increase the risk of another financial crisis. In the wake of the 2008 economic collapse, the Justice Department found that several big banks and other mortgage lenders had violated the Fair Housing Act's disparate-impact standard by steering borrowers of color into more expensive mortgages than white borrowers with similar financial profiles. While lenders profited in the short term, these families were unable to keep up with their payments when housing prices fell, contributing to the chain reaction throughout the financial system. As the crisis demonstrated, we need stronger fair housing laws, not weaker ones that allow lenders to return to the risky -- but lucrative -- practices that set the stage for the last crash.

But the big financial institutions want access to those profits -- no matter the risks. That's why the American Financial Services Association, the American Insurance Association and the American Bankers Association are all pressing the court to eliminate disparate-impact claims. The giant corporations that these groups serve are hoping that limiting a basic civil rights law will give them new ways to tilt the playing field even more steeply against hardworking families.

The promise of our country is our commitment to build opportunities -- not just for some of our families, but for all of our families. We've seen what happens when the narrow, short-term interests of the financial industry take precedence over this basic commitment. We can only hope the Supreme Court has learned that lesson, too."
950795,Opinion: Tax Reform: a Tall Order,9,"By Rep. Scott Garrett

The code is also unfair, as many of the loopholes target small numbers of high-income individuals, while New Jersey's middle-class families get stuck with the tab. It should come as no surprise that New Jersey has one of the highest tax burdens in the nation when you figure in the tidal wave of local, state and federal taxes.

Scott Garrett represents the 5th District in the House of Representatives. He serves on the House Financial Services Committee and the House Budget Committee. He is chairman of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises for the House Financial Services Committee, where he oversees the Securities and Exchange Commission and government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

ON MAY 1, 1931, with the push of a button at the White House, President Herbert Hoover officially commenced the opening of the Empire State Building. The 103-story structure was built with a powerful combination of steel girders, rivets and American ingenuity. This engineering feat and cultural icon took more than 7 million hours to complete.

There is another labor-intensive, American-made feat that happens every April 15. Unfortunately, we don't get the productive equivalent of 192 Empire State Buildings for the 1.35 billion man-hours American workers spend filing tax returns each year. Instead, our outdated and complicated tax code rewards us with sluggish economic growth, wasted resources and a whole lot of frustration around the kitchen table.

We must fix our broken tax code and replace the outdated system with a pro-growth tax system, built upon the tenets of simplicity, fairness and efficiency. This is a tall order, but we have a lot at stake here in New Jersey and across the nation.

Currently, the U.S. tax code is the worst of all worlds. First, the system is notoriously complex, with individuals and families spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year trying to solve a numerical riddle of rules, deductions and tax schedules.

The code is also unfair, as many of the loopholes target small numbers of high-income individuals, while New Jersey's middle-class families get stuck with the tab. It should come as no surprise that New Jersey has one of the highest tax burdens in the nation when you figure in the tidal wave of local, state and federal taxes.

Inefficient tax structure

According to a recent Monmouth University poll, half of New Jerseyans want to eventually leave the state because of the tax burden.

Moreover, the U.S. tax structure is as inefficient as a horse-and-buggy in the age of the high-efficiency hybrid engine. Considerations such as how to legally game the tax code, rather than business fundamentals, often distort individual decisions to work, save and invest. For example, tax economists Seth Giertz and Jacob Feldman argue that the tax code encourages businesses to switch their investments from productive activities (like hiring more workers) toward unproductive ones (like lobbying for special tax preferences).

As a result, not only is our current tax system unfair, but it also wastes resources, slows economic growth and leads to fewer jobs. We need to eliminate the special exemptions, simplify the rates and create a tax code that encourages savings, investment and job creation.

I remain hopeful that President Obama is willing work with Senate and House Republicans to revamp our tax code. Encouragingly, the White House website states ""the tax code has become increasingly complicated and unfair. Under today's tax laws, those who can afford expert advice can avoid paying their fair share and interests with the most connected lobbyists can get exemptions and special treatment written into our tax code."" Mr. President, I couldn't agree more -- now, it's time to put meaning behind your words.

It is also important to recognize the political hurdles facing tax reform. While Republicans will control both the Senate and House in the New Year, without cooperation from the president, tax reform is as good as dead on arrival.

Serious about tax reform

The president has not yet demonstrated that he is serious about bringing tax reform across the finish line. Instead, the president views the tax code as a political tool to punish industries he happens to support (green energy) and those that don't fit the party line, such as the oil and gas industry. Rather than talk about a simplified tax code to encourage job creation, the president remains committed to the theory that increasing the overall tax burden on working families in New Jersey somehow means these families are paying their ""fair share.""

Most recently, the president threatened to veto a tax deal between the Senate and the House. Here is an example of both houses of Congress working together in a bipartisan manner, and the president killed the deal. For tax reform to work, the American people need a willing partner in the White House.

The American people gave Republicans the responsibility of controlling both houses of Congress for the next two years. In return, we can repay the American people by advancing solutions that help America's families. And like President Hoover's dedication of the Empire State Building, hopefully President Obama can work with Republicans to hit the switch and inaugurate another feat of American achievement: a reformed tax code."

Serving in the minority will be a new experience for me, and we don't yet know how the new majority will choose to run the Senate. But my job will remain the same: working hard for Minnesota.

And just as I looked for opportunities to work across the aisle during my first term, when Democrats held the majority, I'm hopeful that we can continue to find areas of agreement. The cable news shows might focus on conflict, but I believe there's consensus to be found.

For example, both sides agree we need to cut wasteful spending so we can fund important priorities like education and research and development without running up the deficit. I know my Republican colleagues have ideas on how to do that; I have some of my own. And I'm hopeful we can find some areas of overlap if we work together.

One area where I hope we can work together is ""delivery reform,"" which can make health care more efficient and cost-effective - for instance, by encouraging providers to focus on helping people stay well instead of just treating them when they get sick. And as a national leader in developing reforms that save money and improve outcomes, Minnesota has a lot to offer the conversation. This isn't a partisan issue; it's just a good idea, and it's not the only one out there.

Workforce development is another. In my first term, inspired in part by partnerships like the one between Lake Superior College and Duluth-area businesses, I helped pass a bipartisan workforce training bill. But there's more we can do to connect businesses, colleges and workers so they can fill some of the more than 3 million jobs employers can't fill because of our ""skills gap.""

Speaking of education, college affordability remains a huge issue. In my first term, I worked to help increase Pell Grants. And in addition to continuing to work to bring down the cost of college, I'll keep fighting to allow 25 million Americans (including 550,000 Minnesotans) to refinance their student debt so they can cut their payments by hundreds, even thousands, of dollars a year.

I was proud that the farm bill we passed last year included a section I helped write to make sure rural Minnesota can benefit from clean-energy and energy-efficiency technologies. And if we want to address climate change going forward - not just for the health of our planet but for the health of our future economy - these technologies must be part of the solution.

We also need more progress on infrastructure; because infrastructure means jobs, plain and simple. I secured increased funding for Great Lakes dredging because it lets ships carry heavier loads without fear of running aground, and I'll keep working to deliver infrastructure funding that helps Minnesota businesses get their goods to market.

My Republican colleagues, of course, have businesses looking for qualified workers and infrastructure projects that need funding in their states, too. I'm hopeful that, on many of these issues, we'll be able to find common ground.

But I also know there will be times when I need to stand my ground.

For example, I'll oppose any effort to chip away at the Wall Street reforms we passed in 2010. Rolling those back, as some want to do, would make us more vulnerable to another economic meltdown like the one that crashed our economy in 2008 and hurt tens of millions of middle-class families.

I'll also stand up to any attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a law that provides enormous benefit to Minnesotans. Since its passage, we've reduced the number of uninsured in our state by 40 percent, and now an unprecedented

95 percent of Minnesotans are covered. We can't go back to the days when Americans with pre-existing conditions were denied coverage or when insurers dropped you if you got sick. We absolutely should work across the aisle to fix problems with the law; but we can't let anyone take away important benefits like allowing children to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26, helping seniors to save billions on prescription drugs, and protecting people with pre-existing conditions.

We have a lot of work to do this year. And while the political landscape in Washington may have changed, my values haven't, and neither has my commitment to working hard for Minnesota. I can't wait to get started.

Sen. Al Franken represents Minnesota in the U.S. Senate."
950990,Nevada Daily Mail - The Keystone Pipeline: A Common Sense Approach,9,"During my career, I've never been afraid to pick a fight -- including with the leaders of my own party -- because we can't let politics trump good policy.

And for the last several years, that's the approach I've taken with construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. While many members of my party have organized in opposition to Keystone's construction, I fought to speed its approval. Because it was never a choice of whether the pipeline would be built -- it was a question of where. We faced a choice of allowing the pipeline to be built in the United States, or of having it built through Canada, and missing out on the jobs and opportunities its construction will create.

I was proud to vote to approve Keystone, which passed the Senate with a bipartisan 62-36 vote.

Over the past two years, I've voted repeatedly to speed approval of this project. I told the secretary of state, as well as President Obama, to expedite its approval. Approval of the southern leg of the pipeline was good news and served as a good opportunity for me to urge the administration to approve the rest of the construction of this infrastructure project.

I spoke to my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, and worked to convince them that this project has broad benefits for both our economy and our energy security. Not all of them were receptive -- Democrats especially -- but if we're going to eliminate our reliance on oil from unfriendly regimes like Iran and Venezuela, then Keystone is a helpful step.

Keystone will also provide a safer, more reliable method of transporting oil through the country -- safer than transport by rail, truck, or barge. The pipeline can better protect property and minimize environmental impact than moving the same oil by train or truck, where more accidents take place. And increased domestic production combined with importing energy resources from allies like Canada will bolster America's national security.

My support for Keystone is also a product of my view that, with energy security an issue of paramount importance, we can't be needlessly taking energy sources off the table. That's why I've also supported the design and production of cheaper, safer, nuclear power, a greater role for renewables and energy storage, and increased oil and gas production on federal lands.

When it comes to Keystone, this process has taken far longer than it should have, but I'm glad that Congress has finally approved this project. The administration's reluctance to embrace this pipeline frustrates many of us.

Partisanship isn't a Missouri value -- we're a state that values independent thinking and commonsense solutions. Those are the values I strived to bring to this debate, and they're the values I'll never stop fighting for."
951140,The Metro West Daily News - Kennedy: Congress Must Join Fight Against Opiate Abuse,9,"By Rep. Joseph Kennedy III

Just one month into 2015, the headlines are sadly familiar: Heroin use rising in Kentucky; Accidental deaths from drug use on rise in North Dakota; Massachusetts sees spike in heroin overdoses, deaths.

For years, the statistics around opiate and heroin abuse have begged for action. Last year the city of Taunton experienced over 200 overdoses alone. In the first 20 days of 2015 the city had 10 more. They are hardly alone.

As our country and commonwealth struggle to stem this epidemic, state-run Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, or PDMPs, are a key element of any solution. Four out of five heroin users first experience addiction through prescription opioids. From helping doctors identify drug-seeking patients to monitoring inappropriate prescription practices, PDMPs work to fend off substance abuse before it starts.

Federal support for these state-level programs is critical. In 2005, the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act (NASPER) was passed by Congress and signed into law, helping fund and run PDMPs across the country. However, for the past four years Congress has failed to fund the program.

This lack of resources has consistently undermined state prescription monitoring efforts. And one essential piece has been jeopardized in particular -- interoperability. That means the ability of one state's PDMP to talk to another state's, to prevent doctor shopping across state lines. In my conversations with service providers and advocates across Massachusetts, this is a concern that comes up time and again, particularly in areas like the SouthCoast, North Shore or Western Massachusetts, where neighboring states are often just a few miles away

NASPER specifically works to address this communications breakdown by requiring any state seeking federal funding for a PDMP to submit a plan for improving communication with bordering states. It is one of the many provisions that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will be considering as we debate NASPER in the days and weeks ahead. At a time when overdoses mount by the day, prescription monitoring is an investment we can no longer afford to shortchange. It's time for Washington to reauthorize NASPER and fully reinstate the program's funding.

Of course, prescription monitoring is just one piece to the puzzle. We need better support systems for the tireless local champions tackling this issue on the ground in every community. We need to achieve true mental health parity, so substance abuse treatment is a right and not a privilege. We need to work with international partners to crack down on drug trafficking. We need to reform reimbursement rates to ensure patients have access to affordable care. We need to support U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark's efforts to help tackle the heartbreaking rise of opiate-addicted newborns and U.S. Rep. Bill Keating and U.S. Rep. Steve Lynch's work to ensure these powerful pills are tamper resistant."
951163,The Boston Globe - Release the Entire 9/11 Report,9,"By Rep. Stephen F. Lynch

When A convicted terrorist and conspicuous former Al Qaeda operative makes disturbing allegations, it is hard not to question his credibility. Zacarias Moussaoui conspired to kill citizens of the United States and will rightly spend the rest of his life in prison. Whatever the motivations for Moussaoui's recent accusations of complicity by foreign agents in the 9/11 attacks, his testimony brings to light important questions. Most notable is the fact that as a nation, we have not fully accounted for the sources of funding and logistical support that enabled Al Qaeda to undertake the terrorist attacks.

In answering those questions it is important to remember that in the aftermath of the attacks Congress undertook a bipartisan ""Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 2001."" This inquiry, by the Senate Select and House Select Intelligence committees, was conducted to investigate the planning and execution of the attacks and to identify any gaps in our intelligence and counterterrorism efforts that may have contributed to our failure to protect the American people.

To the credit of former Senator Bob Graham, who oversaw the inquiry, the investigation was both relentless and judicious in compiling and dissecting the myriad complex relationships that supported Al Qaeda in the run up to 9/11. Importantly, its findings noted, ""The activities of the September 11 hijackers in the United States appear to have been financed, in large part, from monies sent to them from abroad"" and that ""there was also reluctance in some parts of the US government to track terrorist funding and shut down their financial support networks."" The report then identified specific entities, individuals, and detailed transactions in support of those findings. However, just as the findings were to be released, President George W. Bush used his executive authority to excise 28 pages from the report, declaring them classified and refusing to allow them to be published. Unfortunately, almost 14 years after the attacks, those 28 pages remain classified and withheld from the public.

I am in agreement with Graham, Republican Representative Walter Jones of North Carolina, and members of both parties who, like me, have read the 28 pages, and believe that disclosure will not jeopardize sources or methods used in gathering this information and that declassifying the findings is appropriate for a number of reasons.

First, as Thomas Jefferson said, ""An enlightened citizenry is indispensable for the proper functioning of a Republic [and] self-government is not possible unless the citizens are educated sufficiently to enable them to exercise oversight."" In other words, there can be no accountability without transparency.

Second, I have met with spouses, children, siblings, and parents of 9/11 victims as well as representatives of 9/11 Families United For Justice Against Terrorism. They have provided powerful and heart-rending testimony of how important it is to seek the truth and bring to account all those who were responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

Third, at a time when the world continues to face challenges from expanding terrorist organizations, such as ISIS and Islamic Jihad, Jabhat al Nusra, Boko Haram, and Al Shabab as well as Al Qaeda and its affiliates, we must be mindful of the need to bring their financiers and supporters to justice as well.

At an even more basic level, our commitment to one another as citizens in a society that values freedom and justice demands that we hold accountable those who aided and abetted the savage attacks on our homeland and the murder of thousands of innocent Americans. When that fundamental duty to protect American citizens has been breached, it is not enough to say that we will ""never forget."" The military and civilian personnel at the Pentagon, the first responders and office workers in New York, the passengers and crew of those hijacked planes, and all those families whose hearts still ache -- we owe it to them."
951382,The Hill - Embracing America's Energy Opportunity by Building the 'Architecture of Abundance',9,"By Reps. Fred Upton and Ed Whitfield

America is the world's largest producer of natural gas, we are on track to soon become the world's largest crude oil producer, we are a world leader in the development of renewable resources and clean technologies, and we still hold the world's largest coal reserves. The U.S. is now unquestionably the world's greatest energy superpower.

As a global energy leader, we hold the power to fuel an American manufacturing renaissance, improve the standard of living for millions of families, and rewrite geopolitical rules to favor America's global standing and diminish the influence of dangerous regimes. But it's up to Congress and the administration to seize this opportunity.

The Energy and Commerce Committee has spent the last four years examining the stunning changes in our energy landscape and advancing a series of bipartisan solutions to harness America's energy abundance. Despite our best efforts, many of these bills failed to overcome political gridlock. But America's New Congress brings renewed focus to maximize our nation's energy potential.
This Congress, working across the aisle and with our counterparts across the Capitol, the committee will advance a comprehensive energy package designed to build what we call the Architecture of Abundance. Our efforts will focus on four key policy areas: modern infrastructure, a 21st Century energy workforce, energy diplomacy, and efficiency and accountability. By addressing regulatory challenges in these four areas we can begin to fully enjoy the benefits of America's energy abundance.

The increases in North American energy production can lower prices for consumers, but we need to build a modern and effective infrastructure system to transport our affordable energy supplies to those homes and businesses that need them. The American energy boom offers countless opportunities for good-paying jobs, but aspiring energy workers need the right tools and resources to get a foot in the door. America can leverage its position as an energy superpower to achieve diplomatic goals, but policymakers need to understand how domestic energy decisions affect foreign policy. Cutting-edge energy technologies offer efficient new ways to utilize our abundant resources, but we need to cut red tape and encourage further private sector innovation.

We are incredibly fortunate to be in control of our energy destiny, and it's time to change the course of America's policy. Instead of outdated laws that hold on to an era of energy scarcity, we need a comprehensive energy policy that matches today's era of abundance. This is our moment to make the most of our energy greatness. By building the Architecture of Abundance we can embrace the American energy opportunity before us."
944458,Connecticut Mirror - Murphy Breaks Senate Tradition with High-Profile Stands,8,"By Ana Radelat 

With his fight for gun control, defense of the Affordable Care Act and clashes with President Obama on foreign policy, Sen. Chris Murphy broke with a Senate tradition that freshmen should be seen and not heard.

""I don't think there's a waiting period anymore for freshmen,"" he said. ""My constituents did not elect me to be a shrinking violet.""

Ron Schurin, political science professor at the University of Connecticut, said Murphy ""has had a little bit higher visibility than your average freshman senator.

""And he's not been someone who has stood in the shadows of (Connecticut's) senior senator (Richard Blumenthal,) Schurin said.

Having represented Newtown in the House of Representatives before he was elected to the Senate in 2012, Murphy started the 113th Congress with a path set for him.

He became a forceful critic of colleagues who would not support gun control, saying they were complicit in the slaying of 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He also became Public Enemy No. 1 for the gun lobby by attacking the National Rifle Association with a series of reports. One showed the organization did not have much impact on the 2012 elections, despite spending millions of dollars. Another showed a disconnect between the opinions of gun owners and the NRA.

Murphy, 41, favored much tougher gun control measures, including a total ban on assault weapons. But he said his biggest disappointment in the 113th Congress -- and his political career -- was Congress's failure to approve a much more modest bill that would expand FBI background checks of gun owners.

""I've never been as personally and emotionally invested in any issue,"" he said.

He also brought his hard-charging ways to the bitter, ongoing congressional debate over the Affordable Care Act. While other Democrats were trying to avoid the political storm that resulted from the botched rollout of the law, Murphy volunteered to be the health care law's chief protector in the Senate.

Although Democrats once hesitated ""to defend the law at full volume,"" Murphy said he's gratified that as more Americans seek health coverage under the law, Democrats no longer balk at embracing it.

According to the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advocates for open government, Murphy introduced 25 bills in the 113th Congress. Two became law.

One, which Murphy had once sponsored in the House, was introduced in that chamber by Rep. Elizabeth Esty, D-5th District, in this session. It had never passed the Senate until this year. It requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reinstate expired licenses for hydropower dams at two old mills on the Farmington River so they can once again produce electricity.

The other, called the Honor Flight Act, establishes a process to provide expedited airport screening for veterans traveling to visit war memorials.

Gary Rose, head of the political science department at Sacred Heart University, said Murphy could not point to any huge legislative victories, ""but to be fair, that's difficult for a freshman senator."" In addition, the 113th Congress was an unproductive one in terms of the amount of legislation passed.

Prospects of getting legislation approved are likely to dim for Murphy -- and all other Democratic senators -- when the GOP takes over the Senate on Tuesday.

Murphy's reputation in the Senate, however, is not being built on legislation. Besides his high-profile roles on gun control and Obamacare, Murphy came to national attention in September of 2013 when he told Obama (who called the senator at home) that he could not back the administration's policy on Syria.

""I can't say that it was a comfortable position to be in, having a public dispute with the president so early in my freshman term,"" said Murphy, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

He also later clashed with the Obama administration over its plan to arm Syrian rebels to fight Islamic militants known as ISIS.

Murphy said he became wary of U.S. military involvements because of what he's perceived to be the failures of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United State should be able to lead without exerting military power, he said. ""I'm passionate about American's role in the world.""

He said a high point of the last two years was traveling to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in December of 2013 to speak to protesters who were displeased with their government's relationship with Moscow.

Murphy called it ""a truly history-making moment.""

Schurin said he was impressed when Murphy's staff, shortly after he was elected to the Senate, contacted the University of Connecticut's political science department and asked students to submit questions the senator could bring up at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing.

""It was a nice gesture,"" Schurin said.

A balancing act

Murphy said his interest in foreign affairs does not interfere with representing Connecticut interests in the Senate. He also said it's a tradition to have Connecticut senators involved in foreign affairs, noting the international interests of former Sens. Joe Lieberman and Chris Dodd.

""I think he's balancing the two,"" Rose said of Murphy's domestic and foreign agendas.

As a congressman representing the 5th district, Murphy ""had pretty high marks"" taking care of constituents, Rose said. ""So I would think that would translate as good constituent service in the Senate.""

Murphy highlights a Connecticut company every week as ""Murphy's Monday Manufacturer, has spent a day with a homeless man in New Haven and hopped on buses in Meriden, Bridgeport, Stamford, Hartford, Torrington, Waterbury, and New Haven ""to hear what's on people's minds.""

Although Murphy said it's easier to work on a bipartisan basis in the Senate than in the House, Govtrack.us shows that of the 144 bills Murphy cosponsored in 2013, only 16 percent were introduced by a Republican.

Govtrack.us also says Murphy has one of the best voting attendance records in the Senate, having missed only four of the 657 votes cast in that chamber.

Besides his seat on the foreign affairs panel, Murphy is a member of the Joint Economic Committee and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee. He hopes to sit on those panels in the new Congress, which will be gaveled in on Tuesday.

Senate leaders have made note of Murphy's vigorous defense of the Affordable Care Act and have also given Murphy a seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee in the new Congress.

""I am not going to be shy about using my seat on appropriations"" to steer federal funds to Connecticut, Murphy said.

His willingness to join a political fight also means Murphy is likely to be on the attack in efforts to thwart the GOP's agenda this year.

Murphy said he'll also play defense.

""Republicans are not going to back down from their efforts to gut the ACA,"" he said."
944461,"WNPR - Sen. Chris Murphy Pursues Strengthened ""Buy American"" Legislation",8,"By Harriet Jones

Senator Chris Murphy says he believes he can get debate this session on one of his signature issues -- making the US government buy American more often.

On Tuesday, the first day of the legislative session, Murphy will once again introduce his American Jobs Matter Act. The legislation would force the Department of Defense to consider the impact on US employment when it's awarding contracts. Murphy has now introduced this legislation four times - and he says there's still significant opposition from the Pentagon.

""The Department of Defense would technically spend a little bit more money on these contracts if they bought their goods from US companies,"" he told WNPR, ""and the savings would accrue to other parts of the government; less unemployment benefits, more taxes coming in. But the Department of Defense doesn't realize those gains, so they've been fighting this proposal for the last five or six years.

""I'll get it passed eventually because it's the right thing to do,"" he pledged, ""but they've certainly been a barrier thus far.""

But Murphy says despite that, the Department of Defense is changing its practices. It authorized 47,000 waivers to allow it to purchase overseas in 2011. In 2013, the number was around 28,000.

Tighter controls on overseas purchasing could be a boon to the Nutmeg state, according to Murphy. ""The big manufacturers will follow the law no matter what it is,"" he said. ""If Pratt & Whitney, Sikorsky and Electric Boat are required to buy more components from American companies, they're going to look first to Connecticut companies because they have those relationships."""
944954,Wall Street Journal - Obama Threatens to Veto Keystone Pipeline Approval,8,"By Amy Harder and Byron Tau

The Obama administration said Tuesday it would veto legislation that would authorize the Keystone XL pipeline or make a change Republicans want to the Affordable Care Act, hardening battle lines on top GOP priorities the day the party took control of both chambers of Congress.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama would veto legislation approving TransCanada Corp. 's proposed pipeline, which would send up to 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada's oil sands to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Mr. Earnest also said the president wouldn't sign a potential tweak to the health law to alter its definition of a full-time worker, a move that would allow businesses to cover fewer workers.

Congressional Republicans consider Keystone XL's approval one of their top legislative goals and placed it at the front of their agenda as the 114th Congress opened on Tuesday.

The House is expected to vote Friday to approve the pipeline. A Senate vote is expected to follow on Keystone XL legislation introduced Tuesday with 60 co-sponsors, the required number of senators it takes to overcome a legislative filibuster in the 100-member chamber.

The pipeline veto threat drew a rebuke from Republican leaders.

""The president threatening to veto the first bipartisan infrastructure bill of the new Congress must come as a shock to the American people who spoke loudly in November in favor of bipartisan accomplishments,"" new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said.

Mr. Earnest cited the executive branch's ongoing pipeline-review process as the reason Mr. Obama would veto a Keystone bill. ""There's a well-established process that should not be undermined by legislation,"" Mr. Earnest said, pointing to the State Department's internal procedure to approve cross-border pipelines.

The Obama administration has been reviewing the pipeline for more than six years and has said it won't make a decision until litigation in Nebraska involving the project's route is resolved. A ruling in the Nebraska case is expected at any time.

Mr. Obama has been increasingly skeptical of the pipeline's potential to create jobs and lower U.S. energy prices. But the veto threat Tuesday doesn't indicate the president's ultimate decision on the pipeline once the State Department process is complete. Mr. Earnest didn't rule out supporting a broader legislative package that included both Keystone and other policy measures Mr. Obama wanted.

Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.), one of a few Senate Democrats supporting the Keystone legislation, faulted the Obama administration's review. ""You cannot defend that process. Six years to site a pipeline is ridiculous,"" Ms. Heitkamp said in an interview.

Partisan fighting already was threatening to jumble the Senate Republican plan for considering the Keystone bill. Democrats objected to a planned Wednesday committee hearing on the legislation, claiming Republicans were rushing the measure and bypassing standard legislative procedures.

A Republican Senate aide said the disagreement won't slow down the Senate's debate on Keystone because Mr. McConnell used a procedure Tuesday to bypass the committee process and bring the bill straight to the floor. Senate debate could last several weeks.

A spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) faulted Mr. McConnell's move. ""Senator McConnell is signaling that his promises of regular order [for bill approval] have already expired, and that he sees committees as nothing more than rubber stamps for Republican leadership,"" said Adam Jentleson, the spokesman for Mr. Reid.

The Affordable Care Act legislation would alter a provision that requires businesses with 50 or more employees to offer full-time workers insurance or face penalties. It would change the 2010 law's definition of a full-time worker to one who is employed 40 hours a week from the current 30 hours a week. The definition change is part of the GOP's effort to roll back Mr. Obama's signature law."
945025,"The Blaze - Republicans Have an Immigration Plan, and It's a Little Different From Obama's",8,"By Pete Kasperowicz

House Republicans have proposed legislation that would give the Department of Homeland Security two years to gain operational control of high-traffic areas of the border, and impose significant penalties against DHS if it fails to meet that goal, including an end to all bonuses and salary hikes.

The bill requires more infrastructure to secure the border, including new border fencing and the option of using Defense Department equipment to prevent illegal crossings. It also requires aerial surveillance, and more strict ways to measure the government's control of illegal entries.

The Secure Our Border First Act, from Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R-Texas), may well serve as the Republican response to President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration. Democrats have demanded that Republicans take some sort of legislative action to deal with what everyone agrees is America's ""broken immigration system,"" and Republicans have said for years that legislation should start with border enforcement.

""The Secure Our Borders First Act will be the most significant and toughest border security bill ever set before Congress,"" McCaul said. ""We are putting fencing where fencing is needed and technology where technology is needed to ensure a smart, safe, and cost-effective border.""

""We tell the government how to secure the border step-by-step, and put in place real penalties for ignoring the will of Congress,"" he added.

The bill would prevent DHS officials from receiving bonuses and pay increases if DHS fails to gain control of the border in the specified timeframe, refuses to adopt new metrics for measuring border security, or fails to implement a new biometric exit system for illegal immigrants.

Republicans have said control of the border is a necessary first step to immigration reform, and McCaul's legislation would give DHS five years to gain ""operational control"" of the entire border. That term is defined in current law as the ""prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics and other contraband.""

It calls for 27 miles of new border fence, and the construction of more access roads and boat ramps. It would also open up federal lands to border agents that are now closed to them.

Officials would have to step up their aerial surveillance of the border under McCaul's bill. U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Air and Marine division would have to fly aerial drones over the border for a least two-thirds of every day of the week.

Along those lines, it would give border agents access to some military equipment to enforce the border, and provides funding for National Guard assistance.

DHS would also have to create a new set of metrics for measuring the extent to which the border is secure. Among other things, it would require DHS to examine the probability that an illegal immigration would be detected, and the chances that drugs will be seized when moved across the border.

To ensure those metrics are not altered for political reasons, the bill would prevent any DHS political appointees or the White House from reviewing that data before it's released.

McCaul introduced his bill with 14 GOP cosponsors, including 11 from Texas and Arizona. The cosponsors are Reps. Rob Bishop (Utah), Larry Bucshon (Ind.), John Carter (Texas), John Culberson (Texas), Blake Farenthold (Texas), Bill Flores (Texas) Will Hurd (Texas), Martha McSally (Ariz.), Candice Miller (Mich.), Pete Olson (Texas), Ted Poe (Texas), John Ratcliffe (Texas), Pete Sessions (Texas) and Roger Williams (Texas)."
945119,"E&E Daily - Chairman Chaffetz Will Shine Spotlight on Interior, EPA Powers",8,"By Phil Taylor

The House GOP's new top watchdog plans to intensify oversight of the Interior Department and U.S. EPA in the 114th Congress, spotlighting everything from alleged restrictions on federal lands to employee misconduct.

Jason Chaffetz, the recently minted chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, created an Interior Subcommittee to oversee Interior, EPA, and the Energy and Agriculture departments.

The four-term Utahn could be a formidable obstacle for the Obama administration as it pursues executive protections for Western public lands, including national monuments, and seeks to balance energy development with protections for wild lands, water and the climate.

Chaffetz's home state is flush with oil, natural gas and other minerals, but roughly two-thirds of the land is federally controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service and National Park Service.

Chaffetz said he's deeply concerned with the ability of Utahns to access federal lands and the ""ever expanding"" size of the federal estate.

""I'm a huge fan of multiple use,"" Chaffetz said in an interview with E&E Daily. ""We have got to have certainty for these rural communities so that there can be rich energy development at the same time as preservation of some of the most scenic lands in the world.""

Last August, Chaffetz took committee ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) on a tour of rural Utah that included an evening boat ride down the Colorado River, a hike through Arches National Park, an overflight of coal country and a meeting with county commissioners who are fearful of Obama's monument powers.

""I truly appreciated him taking the time and effort to be there"" and understand Western issues, said Chaffetz, who months earlier had joined Cummings on a trip to Baltimore to build political good will. Cummings, whose relationship with former committee Chairman Darrell Isaa (R-Calif.) was anything but smooth, told The Salt Lake Tribune in November that he could work well with Chaffetz.

In Issa's two terms as chairman, the committee held 350 hearings; sent more than 2,000 information requests to government agencies, officials and interested parties; and issued more than 100 subpoenas. It aimed to ""expose waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement at all levels of the federal government.""

Chaffetz's new Interior subpanel will be led by Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who yesterday was also named chairwoman of the Congressional Western Caucus, a GOP group that has vigorously opposed Obama's lands agenda.

The panel's staff director will be Bill McGrath, former legislative counsel with Safari Club International who spearheaded the group's legislative and political strategy around public lands and the Endangered Species Act. At Safari Club, McGrath oversaw legislation on polar bear trophies and ivory regulations and was treasurer of the group's Republican-aligned political action committee.

Chaffetz also hired Machalagh Carr, an oversight staffer from the Natural Resources Committee who led investigations of Obama's energy and wildlife agenda.

Chaffetz said the Interior panel will take a microscope to the Antiquities Act -- the 1906 law that allows presidents to unilaterally set aside lands from energy development -- and the National Environmental Policy Act and ESA. It will also scour the Federal Register for decisions affecting federal lands.

Interior Secretary Sally Jewell has taken note. She set up a half-hour meeting with Chaffetz last month in which the two discussed the need for openness and transparency in the executive branch.

""She asked that we not bombard her with fishing requests,"" Chaffetz said. ""There shouldn't be need for subpoenas. But if they're going to play 'hide the document' with us, we won't play shy.""

Jewell butted heads with former House Natural Resources Chairman Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) over subpoenas and document requests that she argued exceeded the committee's constitutional limits, wasted tax dollars and distracted Interior from its land management duties.

Yet Jewell will be on her toes -- particularly on Utah issues -- with Chaffetz leading Oversight and Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) chairing the Natural Resources panel.

Interior plans to roll out new rules on hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions and royalties in the coming years, and Obama is being lobbied hard by his green allies to designate a Greater Canyonlands National Monument in Chaffetz's district. Those moves will be watched closely by Chaffetz, Lummis and Bishop.

Issa led withering assaults on National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis, who was called to testify before the panel on his agency's handling of Occupy DC, sequestration, the government shutdown and the agency's management of guns.

But it's been a while since an Interior secretary has been called to testify.

Targeting EPA

The panel's other major focus will be EPA, Chaffetz said.

""They have some severe management issues, and their decisions are often without merit,"" Chaffetz said.

Chaffetz said he's frustrated that EPA continues to pay one of its higher-level employees months after he was caught in the act of watching pornography at the office. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy has said she'd welcome congressional efforts to help the agency more easily fire misbehaving employees.

Chaffetz is also miffed that John Beale, the former EPA employee who posed as a CIA agent and pleaded guilty in 2013 to stealing nearly $900,000 in salary and benefits, occupied a position overseeing major air quality issues.

""He testified that he hadn't showed up for years at work,"" Chaffetz said. ""It kind of begs the question, 'How are they implementing all of these rules? Who is in charge? Who is making these decisions? Were they just rubber stamped?'""

EPA was a whipping boy for the Issa-led committee last Congress, thanks in large part to Beale and the porn fiasco.

Issa last summer threatened to hold McCarthy in contempt over subpoenaed documents that he argued the agency was withholding. In September, he and other Republicans began to probe EPA's relationship with the Natural Resources Defense Council as it pushed a power plant emissions rule and scrutinized the proposed Pebble mine in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed.

Chaffetz last month wrote in the Deseret News that the Obama administration is a ""target-rich environment"" for oversight. He pledged ""to create effective reforms that deter future abuses.""

He did not say what kind of legislation he might pursue but pledged to collaborate closely with Bishop and the chairmen of the Appropriations Committee subpanels overseeing the Interior, Energy and EPA budgets.

""I'm not ready to announce any pieces of legislation, but they will fight back these onerous, unilateral decisions by the Obama administration,"" he said.

The Obama administration's green allies are not thrilled with Chaffetz's oversight plans.

""In the last two years alone, the House Natural Resources Committee has wasted more than $2 million of taxpayer money on document requests and time-wasting exercises that are intended to stop professionals at the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service and other agencies from doing their jobs,"" said Matt Lee-Ashley, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a former Obama Interior official. ""It's not clear how creating yet another congressional subcommittee is going to add up to anything other than more political theater and more taxpayer money down the drain."""
945477,St. Joseph News-Press - Paris Attack Renews Concern in Congress,8,"By Ken Newton

Lawmakers back in Washington this week and intent on addressing domestic issues like the economy and energy found themselves with a new international concern to deal with.

Terrorists in Paris killed a dozen people at the office of a French newspaper on Wednesday. Such an attack in an allied nation sent shock waves across the Atlantic Ocean to a capital city that has overseen a war against terror on many fronts.

This brand of violence, focused not on a public landmark but an ordinary commercial structure, creates a new challenge in combating extremists.

""We cannot barricade every small office and public location in America,"" said Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill in the aftermath of the Paris attack. ""This is a free and open society, and that's the way we want to keep it.""

President Obama, leaders of other nations and members of Congress condemned the attack while urging resolve in the fight against terrorists.
Some lawmakers, such as South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham, used the event to criticize the policy choices made by the Obama administration. Another senator, North Dakota's John Hoeven, sought to weave the attack into the congressional debate over the Keystone XL pipeline.

""One of the ways we push back is we take control of our own energy destiny,"" Mr. Hoeven said on the Senate floor.

Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a past member of the intelligence committees in the House and Senate, and rejoining the Senate Intelligence Committee this month, said Thursday in a conference call with reporters that extremist organizations like the Islamic State continue to adapt their tactics.

""These terrorist groups in the Middle East are recruiting new followers and in many cases are saying, don't come here ... practice those things in the country you're living in now,"" the Republican lawmaker said.

As a member of the intelligence panel, Mr. Blunt gets briefings about terrorist threats -- some thwarted, some never coming to pass -- that don't make it to the public view.

""The world is a pretty scary place right now,"" he said.

Ms. McCaskill said that while attacks like the one in Paris are worrisome, monitoring of terrorist activities that might do harm to Americans has improved in the last decade. Those efforts to secure the homeland are essential, she added.

""If we let this kind of attack change our behavior as Americans, then we've allowed them a victory they don't deserve,"" the Democrat said."
945609,Marin News - Huffman Proposes New Gas Tax Based on Carbon Emissions,8,"By Richard Halstead

A new bill proposed by U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman that would create a new federal gas tax that reflects the carbon emissions of the fuel used is gaining attention as Congress struggles to find a way to finance the Highway Trust Fund.

States and cities rely on the Highway Trust Fund, which is supported by the federal gas tax, for money to maintain roads and bridges and to expand transit rail service. Over the years, however, more fuel-efficient cars have resulted in less money going in the trust fund. The gas tax is not indexed for inflation and hasn't gone up since 1993. The trust fund is expected to run out of money by May.

Huffman's Gas Tax Replacement Act of 2015 would replace the 18.4-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline and 24.4-cent-per-gallon tax on diesel fuels with a tax that would be based on the fuel's ""life-cycle assessment of carbon emissions.""

That means different sources of crude oil, biofuels and other inputs into gas and diesels would be taxed differently based not just on fuel combustion within the vehicle but also on emission created during the extraction process and production. The Environmental Protection Agency would make the assessments on which the tax would be based. Emissions would initially be taxed at $50 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions.
 
Not putting his eggs all in one basket, Huffman is also supporting a bill by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat, that would phase in a 15-cent hike in the gas tax and provide for future increases based on the annual rate of inflation.

""I'm trying to contribute to a discussion that has to happen in the next few months,"" said Huffman, a Democrat from San Rafael.

As unlikely as a gas tax increase might seem with a Republican-controlled House and Senate, several Republicans have recently expressed an openness to consider a tax hike. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, who replaced Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, as chairman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, has said a gas tax is ""one of the options"" for dealing with the trust fund's shortfall.

""There are some more Republicans in the Senate expressing an openness to a gas tax increase,"" Huffman said.

Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and John Thune of South Dakota have said they would consider raising the tax, and GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee has sponsored a bill to increase the tax.

Dianne Steinhauser, executive director of the Transportation Authority of Marin, said it has been years since states and counties could count on a reliable stream of funding from the Highway Trust Fund.

""It's been a struggle for quite some time,"" Steinhauser said. Last year, the fund required a last minute, short-term fix to avoid becoming insolvent.

Steinhauser said local projects at particular risk include the Novato Narrows lane addition; a new bridge planned above Sir Francis Drake Boulevard connecting Larkspur Landing and the Ferry Terminal; and work in downtown San Rafael and around the Civic Center to prepare for an extension of the SMART train.

""We're in such dire need on the infrastructure side with both our existing facilities needing maintenance and repair as well as addressing the sea level rise that comes with climate change,"" Steinhauser said

Responding to Huffman's proposed bill, Marin Republican Party chairman Kevin Krick said, ""I do like the fact the Rep. Huffman is looking at the gas tax with a more holistic point of view.""

Krick, however, said he had concerns with the plan to have the EPA determine how much tax energy producers would be assessed and the regressive nature of the tax, which he said would affect middle- and lower-income drivers disproportionately. Krick said he prefers a proposal by former Secretary of State George Shultz for a revenue-neutral carbon tax that would be refunded to taxpayers."
945614,"The Hill - Lawmakers: Metro Smoke Fatality ""Unacceptable'",8,"By Keith Laing

Lawmakers who represent districts in the metropolitan Washington area said Wednesday that a smoke incident on the capital region's Metrorail subway system that left one passenger dead and 80 others injured was ""unacceptable."" 

""It has become clear that communication failures were a key factor in the delay in rescuing passengers from the stopped, smoke-filled train in last week's Yellow Line incident,"" Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said in a statement after receiving an update on the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) investigation into the incident. 

""And it is also clear that the overall response to the fatal incident is unacceptable,"" Connolly continued. ""Changes must be made and made quickly. We must restore public confidence in the Metro system and be able to assure hundreds of thousands of daily Metro riders that their safety is the top priority."" 

Connolly was joined by Sens. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), John Sarbanes (D-Md.), Donna Edwards (D-Md.), John Delaney (D-Md.), Don Beyer (D-Va.), Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) at a press conference about the deadly incident on Metro's Yellow Line. 

Investigators have said the Yellow Line train was heading toward Northern Virginia on Jan. 12 when an electrical issue halted its progress, trapping passengers underground in smoke-filled cars."
945619,"Pasadena Star-News - Rep. Janice Hahn Addresses Longshore Talks, Infrastructure in Speech",8,"By Karen Robes Meeks

Rep. Janice Hahn on Friday addressed the short- and long-term challenges affecting the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, from contract talks between dockworkers and their employers to infrastructure issues.

The congresswoman from San Pedro urged the more than 600 people at the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce's State of Trade and Transportation luncheon to be heard on contract negotiations between the Pacific Maritime Association, the group representing employers, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the group representing 20,000 West Coast dockworkers.

Both groups have been engaged in contract talks since May, with longshore workers working without a contract since July. Talks seem far from settled with both sides accusing each other of creating slowdowns at the ports and digging in their heels on issues on which they remain far apart.

""Make your voice known; make sure they know how important this is,"" Hahn said at the event at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Long Beach. ""We want a fair contract. I'm hopeful that neither side takes any actions right now that are destructive and add to congestion. Everyone needs to stay at the table and negotiate.  There are too many sides needing to be unloaded.""

Because of bottlenecks, 17 container ships remained at sea waiting to be unloaded Friday at the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California.

Hahn said concerns over port congestion issues have rippled back to Washington, D.C., where other members of Congress have been asking about it.

""Because they're hearing throughout this country, in every congressional district, businesses who are feeling what's going on here and not getting their shipments in on time,"" she said.

Hahn said she is also worried about the deteriorating infrastructure, crumbling roads and collapsing bridges that threaten the ports' long-term success.

She touted the passing of her legislation that would give the Los Angeles and Long Beach a bigger share of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, which would help fund needed repairs and upgrades at the ports.

The twin ports have been putting millions into the fund, receiving hardly any money. The legislation now raises that funding to the twin ports by $57 million.

""We've been a donor port way too long and it's time to change,"" she said.

Hahn also introduced legislation that would create a dedicated funding stream for repairing roads, highways and bridges that move goods.

She's proposing the creation of a National Freight Trust Fund by diverting 5 percent of fees already collected on imports that go into the U.S. Treasury's General Fund.

The ports, states and other transportation agencies would then apply for grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Hahn emphasized the importance of the ports as a significant economic engine for the region, the nation and overseas, a business being threatened by congestion.

""Congestion delays and hurts our economy and can do lasting damage by discouraging businesses from using our ports and drive them away,"" she said."
945672,Stars and Stripes - Clay Hunt Veteran Suicide Bill Returns in New Congress,8,"By Travis J. Tritten

A bill to overhaul veteran suicide prevention programs is getting another chance in Congress after being scuttled last month by a retiring Senate budget hawk.

The Clay Hunt SAV Act, named after a Marine veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder who committed suicide, was reintroduced Wednesday by a group of House lawmakers and was expected to be filed in the Senate soon.

It calls for a one-stop website with suicide prevention resources for veterans, more Department of Veteran Affairs psychiatrists and an independent review of current department programs to determine which are effective.

Veteran groups have lauded the bill, and Hunt's parents repeatedly lobbied for it on Capitol Hill. The VA struggles with veterans suicides, estimated at 22 per day.

The House unanimously passed the bill last year and the Senate was poised to do the same, but in the final hours of the 2014 session Tom Coburn, a GOP senator from Oklahoma, blocked a vote, saying the VA could improve services without a new law and budget cuts were needed to pay the $22 million price tag.

""Solutions to this horrific problem will only come from comprehensive, new ideas that improve the accessibility and effectiveness of mental health care available to our veterans,"" Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., said in a statement released Wednesday.

Miller, who chairs the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said it includes ""crucial independent, third-party oversight"" and requires greater VA accountability for its suicide prevention programs.

Rep. Tim Walz, D-Minn., and Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., also co-sponsored the bill.

""We must take action and I continue to believe that this bipartisan bill is a step in the right direction,"" Walz said in a news release. ""We can and must work urgently to send this bill to the president's desk without delay.""

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., will also re-introduce the legislation in the Senate, according to an aide. He filed the bill last year and had 21 co-sponsors.

Another of the bill's allies in the upper chamber of Congress, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., this week was publicly supporting another attempt to pass the bill.

Blumenthal, who is now the ranking member on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, went head-to-head with Coburn last month, urging the Republican to release his hold on the legislation and allow a Senate vote, though the pressure ultimately failed. Coburn was known for his harsh criticisms of government spending and his annual publication the Wastebook, which listed what he considered the most egregious cases.

Coburn argued that a massive overhaul of the VA passed last summer already pumped billions of dollars into fixing its programs and said that Congress should spend this year pressing the department for results on suicide prevention.

""Don't pass another bill; hold the VA accountable,"" he said in a Dec. 15 floor speech.

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of American, a veterans' service group, has vigorously supported the Clay Hunt bill and says it agrees the VA oversight is needed but that it must be coupled with specific changes to the suicide prevention programs.

For example, the bill creates new incentives for hiring more psychiatrists and would force the VA to address a critical lack of staff, according to the group.

But it is unlikely the bill will need to survive the same staunch opposition or criticism in the Senate, said Alex Nicholson, the IAVA legislative director.

Coburn was virtually the sole opponent and nearly all other Senators from the prior session appeared on board. The group is still feeling out some freshmen lawmakers.

""We expect the House to move a lot quicker and most likely the Senate will take up the House-passed version on the floor in February,"" Nicholson said."
945783,Bloomberg - Meet the Congressman Who Will Watch Our Spies,8,"By Eli Lake & Josh Rogin

Representative Devin Nunes may not be well known outside of his California congressional district or the Washington beltway, but he is about to become one of the most important figures in the U.S. national security state.    

As the new chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Nunes is one of ""gang of eight"" members of Congress who will be briefed on the U.S. government's most classified military and intelligence programs. When the president orders a hostage rescue, or when the FBI unmasks an important foreign spy, Nunes will be one of the few people without a formal security clearance to know about it.

In response to our written questions, Nunes sketched out his agenda for the committee in the new Congress. On some issues, such as nuclear negotiations with Iran and closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, don't expect big changes from the approach of outgoing chairman Mike Rogers. But unlike Rogers, Nunes said he was not satisfied with the committee's report on the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on U.S. facilities at Benghazi, Libya, and still believed key witnesses need to be interviewed. He also rejected the idea of potentially reforming the legal structure behind America's vast surveillance state.

Specifically, Nunes told us he was going to be looking to persuade his colleagues to reauthorize the provisions of the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that allow the federal government to collect and store troves of telephone records. He also said he didn't intend to support reforms to the secret court that approves FBI and NSA wiretapping of suspected spies and terrorists.  

Nunes said the conclusions of a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate -- which found Iran had halted its program to develop technology to miniaturize components for an atomic explosion suitable for a weapon -- were no longer relevant. He noted that many members of Congress did not think Iran was negotiating in good faith.

Nunes also said the intelligence community had warned the Obama administration about the spread of Islamist fighters across Iraq and Syria since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, but didn't say whether the Obama administration's plan to train and arm a new Syrian rebel army was likely to work -- or whether the administration should have armed the rebels years ago, as top intelligence officials including then-CIA Director David Petraeus argued for at the time.

On North Korea, Nunes said that many in Washington have underestimated the young leader Kim Jong Un, and that Pyongyang's nuclear-stockpile building was the major concern: ""I think he's proven as capable -- and potentially more dangerous -- than his father.""

The incoming chairman had some very specific of criticisms of President Barack Obama, as the White House re-engages in a global war on terrorism the president in 2013 said he intended to wind down. Nunes said he opposed Obama's efforts to close Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba; thought it was a mistake for Obama to call the CIA's interrogation of suspected al Qaeda leaders ""torture""; and described Obama's Syria policy as ""strategic incoherence.""

Nunes was particularly critical of Obama's emphasis on America's defeat of ""core"" al-Qaeda, or the group's senior leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""The overemphasis by the administration on our successes against ""core al Qaeda' gives the American public the impression that we are somehow safer today than we were after 9/11,"" he said. ""That is simply not the case.""

These views definitely make Nunes a conservative on national security. And if there was any doubt about his general right-wing credentials, consider that he has been singled out by environmental groups in his home state for his efforts to reform laws such as the Endangered Species Act.    

Yet Nunes has also worked closely with his colleagues across the aisle. When he was the chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee dealing with trade policy, he crafted bipartisan bills with Representative Charles Rangel, the liberal democrat from New York. 

Nunes is conservative, but not a part of the insurgent faction of Republicans in Congress. Nunes was appointed to his job by House Speaker John Boehner, who is reviled by the Tea Party and prominent conservative talk-radio hosts such as Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh. Nunes has been a loyal ally to Boehner and helped run his campaign for House leadership.

In early December, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius wrote that Boehner's selection of Nunes was a sop to right-wing members of his own party because of the Californian's efforts to investigate Benghazi attacks. In late 2013, Nunes disclosed a letter he wrote to Boehner raising several unanswered questions about the administration's timeline for the terrorist attack. 

Nunes told us that he did not end up endorsing the intelligence committee's report on Benghazi released late last year because key witnesses -- who were at the scene of the attack -- were not interviewed. Nonetheless, Nunes said the intelligence committee would not be conducting a new investigation of Benghazi, but would support the work of the select committee on Benghazi that Boehner formed last year.

Representative Mac Thornberry, the new Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee who served with Nunes on the intelligence committee, said he believed his colleague's concerns about Benghazi were reasonable. ""He was in touch with some folks who had information about what happened and felt strongly that that view not only needed to be probed, but also should be a basis for getting more information,"" Thornberry told us.

On Benghazi, Nunes ended up being more critical of the administration's actions than his predecessor Rogers, a Michigan Republican who retired from Congress this year. Nunes praised Rogers and told us he would seek his advice. That said, Nunes said he did not intend to emulate his predecessor when it came to television appearances. Rogers, when he was chairman of the committee, became a fixture of the major cable news outlets and Sunday shows in Washington. Nunes said he would be taking a much lower profile, saying his predecessor was ""much better looking and more telegenic than I am."""
945785,McClatchy DC - Terror Attack Greets Intelligence Panel Chief in First Days on the Job,8,"By Mike Doyle

California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes started his new spy-oversight work with a jolt.

On Tuesday, at the opening of the 114th Congress, he claimed the gavel as chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. About 18 hours later, two men carrying automatic weapons and shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" -- ""God is great"" -- killed 12 people and wounded 11 at the Paris office of a French satirical magazine.

""There's nothing like the first day on the job and having a massive terrorist attack,"" Nunes said in an interview this week. ""The ink hadn't even dried from when I was officially appointed.""

But terror wouldn't wait. On Wednesday, Nunes and his intelligence panel members convened in their tightly secured, underground office for about 25 minutes to discuss the Paris attack. The committee met again for about 30 minutes Thursday for an update.

And this was just the start for Nunes, a 42-year-old lawmaker in his sixth term in the House of Representatives. Coming from a largely agricultural district in California's San Joaquin Valley, Nunes must now oversee a bureaucratically savvy and technically sophisticated community accustomed to keeping its own counsel.

""The intelligence oversight job is exceptionally difficult,"" said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. ""They need to adapt to an oversight environment which is both secretive, for security reasons, and yet is also intensely politicized.""

The congressional overseers, Aftergood added, ""need to be familiar with a range of intelligence disciplines, and at least somewhat acquainted with the underlying techniques and technologies."" The oversight can be even more awkward, he said, because lawmakers are ""almost entirely dependent on the agencies that they oversee.""

A graduate of California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, where he majored in agricultural business, Nunes didn't serve in the military or intelligence services. Instead, he's learned the intelligence business as a member of the House committee for the past four years.

House Speaker John Boehner initially selected Nunes for the panel and then tapped him to replace the retired Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, a former Army officer and FBI agent, as chairman.

""He's a good man,"" Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the committee's former top Democrat, said of Nunes. ""He's smart, he's hardworking and he's taking his job very seriously.""

Nunes also has a good sense of humor, Ruppersberger added. This can help, committee members note, during the long overseas trips that come with the intelligence territory.

In 2013, House travel records show, Nunes went on Intelligence Committee business to Europe for five days in November and to Europe and the Middle East for 14 days in August. Public records for the House Intelligence panel members don't identify the countries visited.

Hint: They're not all garden spots.

""My goal is to make sure we are getting our members out to every corner of the world,"" Nunes said. ""You cannot conduct serious oversight work without getting on the ground and actually talking to the folks that are doing the work.""

As chairman, Nunes said his own foreign travel might change somewhat, though the father of three young children also hopes it doesn't become more frequent. The chairmanship brings with it enough other private and public demands.

As a member of the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" -- party leaders from both houses of Congress and the top Republican and Democrat on their respective Intelligence committees -- Nunes will be notified of certain particularly sensitive covert actions. He's also part of the ""Gang of Four,"" lawmakers informed of certain other intelligence actions. This group is composed of the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence panels.

During the George W. Bush administration, for instance, the Gang of Eight was among the few initially briefed about the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance program. Joining Nunes in the current Gang of Eight is the House committee's new ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California.

""There will be no shortage of issues to come before Congress in this session,"" Schiff predicted.

Publicly, too, the chairmanship brings fresh demands. Rogers, Nunes' predecessor, regularly accepted the media invitations that the position attracts like metal filings to a magnet. Since 2009, data compiled by American University researchers show, Rogers appeared more than 62 times on the Sunday television talk shows. Only four other members of Congress appeared more often.

Rogers has now retired and the media's appetite has shifted to Nunes, whose office received about a dozen requests from reporters and television producers following the Paris attack. Nunes, though, suggested he'll be appearing less frequently as he concentrates on his covert responsibilities.

""We have to watch over the intelligence community to make sure we know everything they are doing, when they are doing it, and make sure that our colleagues are in the loop, so there are no surprises,"" he said.

On intelligence policy, Nunes resembles Rogers in some ways. Like his predecessor, Nunes thinks it was a mistake for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to make public its 525-page executive summary of CIA detention and harsh interrogation practices. Similarly, he's supportive of the NSA's expansive surveillance practices.

Pointedly, Nunes told the news outlet Politico last year that Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash was ""al Qaida's best friend in the Congress"" for pushing an anti-surveillance amendment. Rogers was likewise harsh in his denunciations of Amash, whose 2013 amendment cutting surveillance fell just short of passage in a 205-217 vote.

Nunes is quietly making some changes to the committee, which had 21 members and a staff of about 30 in the preceding Congress. Damon Nelson, an Air Force veteran and San Joaquin Valley native who's long handled water issues for Nunes, has shifted over to the committee as a senior adviser.

Nunes has also rejiggered the panel's subcommittees, designing four to handle specific intelligence agencies. Indicative of the phraseology that permeates the spook world, Nunes said one of the new subcommittees would handle ""defense and overhead architecture."" This means spy satellites.

The new subcommittees, Nunes said, will play a bigger role in writing the annual intelligence authorization bill, which sets funding and policy for agencies that range from the satellite-operating National Reconnaissance Office to the eavesdropping and code-breaking NSA.

""My hope is when you empower a subcommittee chairman, you can cover a lot more ground,"" Nunes said.

The most recent intelligence authorization act easily passed the House by a bipartisan 325-100. The publicly released bill itself, at only 23 pages, barely scratches the surface. Key details, including dollar amounts, remain classified. It's a lot, though. All told, the intelligence community has divulged that it spends roughly $50 billion a year.

Key committee deliberations also remain cloaked.

In November 2013, for instance, Schiff offered an amendment to require an annual report on U.S. drone strike casualties. The committee debated in secret. Back in public, Nunes joined in voting down the amendment by 15-5.

Schiff praises Nunes' work on the committee, and the two are mutually respectful. The 2013 disagreement on drone strikes, though, likely presaged future policy debates between the key lawmakers, some of which the public will never hear.

""I think I'm an even broker,"" Nunes said, ""and will do my best to work with Mr. Schiff."""
946657,St. Joseph News-Press - Graves Reflects on Tenure as Committee Chair,8,"By Ken Newton

A fundamental problem exists for small businesses trying to abide by federal regulations, Congressman Sam Graves believes.

Because of their lack of personnel, the companies might not even realize they're out of compliance.

""They don't have the resources to have a division or department that's devoted to regulatory compliance,"" the North Missouri lawmaker said Tuesday. ""They have to depend on themselves to figure out what has to be done.""

Mr. Graves, a Tarkio Republican, made the remark while discussing his four-year tenure as chairman of the U.S. House Small Business Committee. Because of party rules, he has term-limited out of that leadership position.

But he looks back on the time as productive in terms of legislation passed and raising the level of awareness in Congress about issues dealing with small businesses.

""Even where it might not be a primary area of jurisdiction for the Small Business Committee, we pushed other committees of relevance into the argument,"" Mr. Graves told the News-Press in an interview.

Regulation by federal agencies proved a particular area of interest during his chairmanship, and Mr. Graves would describe many of the executive edicts as ""onerous"" and ""over the top.""

In January 2013, his committee launched a website called ""Small Biz Reg Watch,"" where business owners could follow changes in federal regulations. This served as a complement to the committee's ""Open Mic,"" through which people could share their experiences in dealing with the federal government.

""We hear about things that small businesses are facing that either don't make sense or rise to the level of ridiculous,"" the chairman said. ""It's been eye-opening just to see what small businesses are going through, in some cases that we don't even know about.""

Small businesses also feel the pinch of uncertain tax policy, Mr. Graves said. He noted that making permanent a reasonable threshold for Section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation provisions would allow companies to expand, improve their equipment and strengthen their inventory.

Instead, small businesses look from year to year without knowing about future levels in these tax areas, he said.

""With this short-term extension process we continue to go through, it makes it very tough for them to be able to plan,"" the lawmaker said.

Mr. Graves said his chairmanship also gave him a fresh perspective on the way legislation gets passed. The Republican worked closely with Democratic Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, his counterpart in the Senate, in guiding the reauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research Program.

In addition, the representative from a largely rural area said he had a good working relationship with the committee's top Democrat, Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez, who represents a district in New York City.

""Nydia and I couldn't be farther apart in terms of demographics of our districts and, obviously, political philosophies,"" he said, ""but I listened to what she had to say and she listened to me, and we were able to come up with good legislation.""

Mr. Graves, going into his eighth House term, will serve on the House Armed Services Committee during the next session and awaits an official announcement on a chairmanship on a subcommittee on another panel."
947232,WND Faith - Obama Slammed for Staying Mum on Israel Sanctions,8,"By Bob Unruh

A member of Congress from North Carolina has put together a letter -- signed by dozens of his colleagues -- asking President Obama whether he is trying to impose sanctions against America's longtime and staunch ally Israel.   

""Recent reports suggest that your administration has held classified meetings over the past several weeks to discuss the possibility of imposing sanctions against Israel for its decision to construct homes in East Jerusalem. We urge you and your administration to clarify these reports immediately,"" said the letter assembled by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. 

""I'm appalled that the administration would even consider the idea of sanctioning Israel -- one of our closest allies. We need clarification from the White House on this immediately,"" Meadows said. 

""What message does it send to the world for the U.S. to impose sanctions against Israel while easing sanctions on Iran -- a state-sponsor of terror with an abysmal human rights record?"" Meadows added. 

There have been a number of recent reports on the question. 

At the Free Beacon, a report said the White House on Thursday refused to discuss the questions. And State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf ""dodged several questions,"" the report said. Then White House spokesman Josh Earnest followed the same script. 

The report said Israel's daily Ha'aretz had written about the meetings that reportedly included officials from both the State Department and the White House. 

Such move would take the Obama White House, which is been cold and distant to America's ally, to new levels of antagonism, critics said. 

Meanwhile, Obama's administration is actively trying to prevent Congress from approving new sanctions against Iran. 

The Beacon reported, ""One senior congressional aide who works on the issue of Israel expressed shock that a White House could even discuss such action."" 

On Friday, Meadows authored a letter, and was joined by 44 colleagues, to Obama demanding clarification of the reports. 

Signers included Reps. Kerry Bentivolio, R-Mich.; Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla.; Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn.; Jim Bridenstine, R-Mich.; Larry Buschon, R-Ind.; Curt Clawson, R-Fla.; Doug Collins, R-Ga.; Paul Cook, R-Calif.; Ron DeSantis, R-Fla.; Jeff Duncan, R-S.C.; Chuck Fleishmann, R-Tenn.; Virginia Foxx, R-N.C.; Scott Garret, R-N.J.; Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.; Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.; Tim Griffin, R-Ariz.; Michael Grimm, R-N.Y.; Joe Heck, R-Nev.; Richard Hudson, R-N.C.; Sam Johnson, R-Texas; Jim Jordan, R-Ohio; Mike Kelly, R-Pa.; Peter King, R-N.Y.; Doug Lamborn, R-Colo.; Leonard Lance, R-N.J.; Billy Long, R-Mo.; Tom McClintock, R-Calif.; Luke Messer, R-Ind.; Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C.; Alan Nunnelee, R-Miss.; Pete Olson, R-Texas; Steven Palazzo, R-Miss.; Robert Pittenger, R-N.C.; Mike Pompeo, R-Kan.; Bill Posey, R-Fla.; Reid Ribble, R-Wis.; Todd Rokita, R-Ind.; Matt Salmon, R-Ariz.; Aaron Schock, R-Ill.; David Schweikert, R-Ariz.; Pete Sessions, R-Texas; Adrian Smith, R-Neb.; Jackie Walorski, R-Ind.; and Joe Wilson, R-S.C. 

The letter to Obama urges him to ""clarify"" what's going on. 

""At no point in time has Congress given the administration the authority to sanction Israel. In fact, Congress has continued to show its unwavering support for Israel and has recently taken steps to increase our economic and military cooperation. At a time when you have requested an additional seven months to negotiate with Iran over its nuclear weapons program, any attempts to undermine the U.S.'s support of Israel will only further diminish the administration's ability to get congressional support for any potential agreement with Iran,"" it says. 

""The fact that your administration has failed to denounce or clarify them is deeply troubling. The United States must stand firm in its commitments to Israel, or we risk fracturing our relationship with Israel and other key partners across the globe. We urge you to quickly and sharply address these concerns, as well as take the steps necessary to demonstrate America's unwavering support for Israel."" 

Jennifer Dekel, director of research and communications for the Endowment for Middle East Truth, told WND, ""Reports that the White House would even consider imposing sanctions on our greatest ally in the Middle East, the only democracy in the region that safeguards the rights of minorities, women, and all religions, is another example of this administration's twisted policy of punishing our allies and rewarding our enemies."" 
She continued, ""It is reprehensible that the administration is telling Congress not to put sanctions on Iran, a country that the U.S. is technically at war with, and which is the leading state sponsor of terrorism, yet would call for sanctions on Israel. If the reports are true, the act of sanctioning Israel would be unprecedented, and would signal a major and dangerous policy shift of U.S. foreign policy."""
947658,Great Falls Tribune - Rep. Zinke's Expectations for State of the Union,8,"By Ryan Zinke

Tuesday evening, President Obama will deliver the annual State of the Union Address. It is the one time each year that Congress and America can hear the president lay out his agenda for the country.

This year is particularly important because of what we face in today's world. Too many Montana families, seniors and veterans are struggling to get by, and our nation is facing a growing Islamic jihadist threat. People are looking to the president for leadership; so far he has not delivered.

With a new Congress, the president has the opportunity to move forward on issues that are important to Montana's economy and our national security. I am optimistic that Congress will get the job done for Montana and will be listening to the President's speech closely for two particular areas: the economy and national security.

Families in Montana are struggling to make ends meet in Obama's part-time economy. Taxes are too high. Tuition is too expensive. Veterans aren't receiving the care they deserve. And Obamacare is a disaster. I want to hear the president present at least one bipartisan solution to address these kitchen table issues. The Washington way of throwing money at a problem with no solution does not work.

It is estimated that federal regulations put an extra $15,000 burden on every Montana household. That is money that should be going toward retirement, a down payment on a home, or sending the kids to college -- not to the federal government. As a state senator, I helped craft legislation that provided regulatory relief for some of Montana's poorest families, and last week I voted to reduce the federal costs families face. But more must be done.

In the past, the president proposed costly carbon tax plans that would cause utility and gas prices to skyrocket, and essentially shut down any hope of developing Montana's coal industry. It is my hope the president will abandon these ill-advised ideas, and instead choose to work together to come up with bipartisan solutions that lower costs to families and create good-paying jobs.

Finally, the president must present a clear and concise plan to combat the growing threat of Islamic terrorism. His no show foreign policy is not cutting it -- neither with our allies, nor our enemies.

Currently, the president refuses to even use the words Islamic and terrorism in the same sentence, yet that is exactly the threat we face. I spent more than 20 years as a Navy SEAL, many of which were dedicated to fighting these exact threats in the Middle East following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.

To win the war on Islamic terror it will take an aggressive approach abroad, as well as securing the southern border, and in effect, our homeland. The southern border has become a nexus for national security and immigration. A recent report by U.S. Customs and Border Protection found that people from 75 countries illegally crossed the border between the U.S. and Mexico from countries like Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia, which are hotbeds for Islamic terrorists. It is my hope the president will do the right thing for America and announce he will reject the radical leftist plan to shut down the Department of Homeland Security.

There are several other issues important to Montana that I am working on daily -- reforming federal management of our forests, making public lands public, improving the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Veterans Administration, the list goes on -- but tonight, I expect the president to lay out a clear agenda that secures our nation and strengthens our economy.

Congressman Ryan Zinke was sworn in to the U.S. House of Representatives on Jan. 6. Before serving in Congress, Zinke served in the Montana State Senate representing Whitefish and is a 23-year Navy SEAL veteran."
947686,New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie Visits Drug Treatment Center in U.K.,8,"By Heather Haddon

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton have found common cause in a social issues they care about: drug treatment.

On Tuesday, his third day of a U.K. visit, Mr. Christie toured Hope House, a residential addiction-recovery facility in South West London. The Duchess has helped financially support Action on Addiction, an organization that provides funding for the 22-bed facility for women.

Stateside, Mr. Christie has made drug treatment one of his main social-welfare programs. The Republican has connected his antiabortion stance with the need to value the lives of all people, including the drug-addicted.

""When I talk to folks in my party about home about being pro-life, I said it's easy to be pro-life when you are in the womb,"" Mr. Christie said to Hope House staff and executives. ""If you are pro-life, tell me that you're pro-life for a kid who is lying on a jail floor basement, addicted to drugs.""

He referred to addiction as a disease, nodding while listening to staffers talk about the need to lower the stigma many drug addicts face.

Mr. Christie's mother, a lifelong smoker who died from lung cancer, didn't encounter the negative reactions that people undergoing drug treatment often do, he said.

""No one saw her lying in that hospital bed when she was dying and said, look, she got what she deserved,"" said Mr. Christie, who often speaks about the influence his mother had on his life. ""Why do we feel differently for someone who falls victim to drug or alcohol abuse?""

The visit perhaps offered a welcome change for Mr. Christie, following reactions to comments he made Monday on taking a ""balanced approach"" to vaccinations for children.

Asked about an outbreak of measles in the U.S. and whether the government should require vaccinations, he said he understood parents who felt concerns about immunizations. The father of four said he vaccinated all four of his children.

A spokesman for the governor later issued a clarification of Mr. Christie's comments, saying that the governor supports mandatory vaccinations for measles, but that state rules on immunizations vary and therefore the government's approach should show flexibility.

Mr. Christie didn't take press questions after he spent about half an hour meeting with Hope House workers and residents.

Before the visit, he held a private meeting with executives of financial companies that are members of TheCity UK, a trade group that lobbies parliament on financial services and seeks to lower trade barriers.

Afterward, Mr. Christie had lunch with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, one of the highest-ranking members of Prime Minister David Cameron's cabinet, but didn't make formal remarks as previously scheduled.

""We had a lot of fun,"" Mr. Christie said in response to a question about the lunch."
948592,News & Record - House Unanimously Approves Walker's First Bill,8,"By Kate Elizabeth Queram

The U.S. House of Representatives today unanimously approved a bill from freshman U.S. Rep. Mark Walker, a Greensboro Republican.
It was Walker's first-ever piece of federal legislation. He is the first freshman member of the 114th class of Congress to pass a bill.
 
Known as the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015, the legislation -- house bill H.R. 460 -- aims to better train and inform Department of Homeland Security workers for detecting and intercepting human traffickers and their victims.
The bill, introduced last week, is co-sponsored by 24 members of Congress, including Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican from western North Carolina.
Ninety-eight cases of human trafficking were reported in North Carolina in 2014, and the state ranks 12th in the nation, according to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center.
""North Carolina is often ranked as a top state for labor and sex trafficking,"" Walker said in a statement. ""We must act to end this unconscionable industry.""
The bill will expand the scope of mandatory training for federal officials without increasing spending, as well as require the Department of Homeland Security to keep a record of the number of reported and confirmed human-trafficking cases.
The legislation also will provide curricula to state and local governments and private organizations seeking to establish training programs for human-trafficking awareness."
948596,The Times News - Walker's First Legislation Targets Human Trafficking,8,"Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Walker introduced his first bill in Congress on Monday, legislation that would require border patrol and Transportation Security Administration agents to be trained on identifying victims and perpetrators of human trafficking.


The bill, H.R. 460 -- the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 -- is coincidentally being introduced in the final days of National Human Trafficking Awareness Month, which takes place in January, Walker's office said in a news release.

""This is something I had concerns with long before I arrived in the House,"" Walker, who represents the 6th District, including a part of Alamance County, said Monday of the human trafficking issue.

He said he has had a ""growing passion and concern for this"" since his wife, an emergency room nurse practitioner, helped launch a sexual assault examination program 20 years ago.

Walker said around a year ago, he sat down with members of the local anti-human trafficking organization Alamance for Freedom to learn more about the issue and some of the problems at hand.

Though the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2014 was introduced in July and passed in the House, the Senate took no action on the legislation last year. Walker is among nearly 20 co-sponsors introducing it again and providing an official presentation on the legislation today in Washington.

Walker's office said in a news release that the act ""expands the scope of mandatory training for (Department of Homeland Security) officials without increasing federal spending.""

Walker said the new human trafficking curriculum would be incorporated into regular training that TSA and border patrol agents already receive. These officials would be trained to identify ""not just the victim, but also the perpetrator,"" he said. ""The training would be to look for signs of those doing the trafficking.""

The bill would require DHS to keep records of the number of human trafficking cases reported or confirmed, and report annually to Congress on them.

It also authorizes training curricula for any state, local, or tribal government or private organization seeking to establish a human trafficking awareness training program.

Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers introduced a separate human trafficking bill last week in the House. She represents the 2nd District, which includes a small section of Alamance County.

The Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care Act of 2015 -- H.R. 398 -- would require the Department of Health and Human Services to award a grant to a medical or nursing school in each of the department's 10 administrative regions. The grant would be used to ""develop best practices for health care professionals"" to ""recognize, respond, and intervene on behalf of human trafficking victims."""

Last week, Congressman Mark Walker (R-North Carolina) introduced his first bill since taking office -- the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 (H.R. 460). The freshman lawmaker explains it is designed to provide training for Homeland Security personnel to better detect and to intercept human traffickers and their victims.

Walker
""These individuals have become very crafty at trying to integrate these victims -- which are mostly young ladies -- as part of a family [or] part of a group traveling together,"" he tells OneNewsNow. ""And there are certain questions to ask -- without revealing all of those that law enforcement have shared -- to be able to separate and to be able to identify these potential victims.""

According to Walker, an estimated 17,500 victims are brought into the U.S. each year, most often for labor or for prostitution. ""Even more tragic, nearly half of these victims are children,"" he notes.

The Republican congressman, whose state is often ranked as a top state for labor and sex trafficking, says the ""unconscionable industry"" is an increasing problem that needs to be halted or, at the very least, slowed down.

""Right now we're closing in -- and these are conservative estimates. [There are] close to 20,000 people who are being trafficked in the U.S. alone, and 21 million people ultimately worldwide,"" he laments. ""But because of the profitability or the wealth of this country, we're seeing a spike and a rise and an expansion of it.""

Walker expects a vote on his bill later today in the House. Nine other members of Congress are co-sponsors of H.R. 460."
948601,Walker Introduces Legislation to Combat Human Trafficking,8,"By Kate Disbrow

Last week, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-6) introduced his first bill, H.R. 460, the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015. This bipartisan legislation works to effectively train and inform Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel to better detect and intercept human traffickers and their victims. Rep. Walker is joined by Rep. Mark Meadows (NC-11), House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul (TX-10) and seven additional Members of Congress in introducing this legislation.

""21 million people are estimated to be victims of human trafficking worldwide and this depravity is happening in our own backyards. North Carolina is often ranked as a top state for labor and sex trafficking, and we must act to end this unconscionable industry,"" said Rep. Walker. ""An estimated 17,500 people are trafficked through the U.S. each year--even more tragic, nearly half of these victims are children. The majority of these victims will pass by either Border Patrol or TSA, and we must make certain these agents are properly trained in the current trends and practices to end human trafficking. One victim of human trafficking is one too many.""

""Human trafficking is one of the great injustices of our time. I'm grateful to Congressman Walker for his leadership on this important piece of legislation. We must continue to do all that we can to end the tragedy of modern day slavery,"" Congressman Mark Meadows (NC-11) said.

""Last year, I held a Committee hearing in Texas where we heard from courageous survivors of human trafficking, as well as State and local law enforcement on how we can work together to combat this horrific crime. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a critical role in this effort,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security. ""I am a proud to once again co-sponsor the Human Trafficking Detection Act, and I will continue to push for further measures to fight human trafficking within the United States and around the world.""

The Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 expands the scope of mandatory training for DHS officials without increasing federal spending. It also assists local law enforcement by authorizing the Secretary to provide training curricula to any state, local, or tribal government or private organization seeking to establish a human trafficking awareness training program. Additionally, it requires DHS to start keeping records of the number of human trafficking cases reported or confirmed and report annually to Congress on these incidents."

948607,News & Record - A Pledge to be Open,8,"By Mark Walker

Following the start of the 114th Congress, the News & Record's Susan Ladd published an open letter to me, your new congressman. I would like to address her comments and all the constituents of North Carolina's 6th District:

While I have only been in office for a couple of weeks, my adult life has been about serving and leading others. I am firmly grounded in my conservative principles and I will not hide from tough choices. At the same time, the needs and priorities of our district will be central to my decisions. I am dedicated to listening as the first step and will continue to reach out to community leaders for all perspectives.

I intend to be open with the voters and conduct our office with the highest level of service and respect. As Ms. Ladd reiterated, I was elected to serve every constituent of the 6th District. I can assure you that I feel the weight and privilege of that duty every day.

From the start, I have been personally committed to an open dialogue with the entire community. Our team is already expanding our presence on social media, using these new platforms to improve our accessibility. I encourage you to connect with us online at https://walker.house.gov/ and on social media. We are working on opening additional offices and will be hosting events throughout the district. Our office is committed to proactive constituent engagement and not losing sight of why we are here -- to serve you.

Throughout this journey, I have worked to bring people together. As Ms. Ladd stated, we ""demonstrate(d) that even people on opposite ends of the political spectrum could find areas of agreement and commonality."" In two years, I want to be judged on my legislative record and my ability to bring people together. In my opinion, this is the cornerstone of genuine leadership.

I will stand for limited government, personal responsibility and traditional values -- which will not appease every voter -- but I will listen first, learn from others, make independent decisions and communicate that information back to the people.

Despite the vitriol and harshness of modern politics, I am undeterred in my goal to share hope through the values and principles that make our country great. Ronald Reagan, one of my personal models of leadership, remained steadfast despite the names hurled at him early in his presidency.

It is always easiest to simply ""preach to the choir."" You are guaranteed applause, and the people hail you as a hero, yet it is consistently the same audience. The true test is successfully taking the message to new demographics and communities -- those who have lost faith or struggle to achieve the American Dream.

Last week, members of Congress had the opportunity to hear from the former prime minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair. He stated, ""America's job is not to be loved, but rather America's job is to lead."" What a reminder of the proper perspective needed in all our lives.

My pledge, as your congressman, is to be open, to listen, to work to bridge traditional political and cultural divides, and to stand for what I believe is right. We look forward to hearing from you and working together to help the 6th District."
948613,Rhino Times - Mark Walker Hears POTUS Live And In Person At SOTU,8,"By John Hammer

Sixth District Congressman Mark Walker attended his first State of the Union address on Tuesday night, Jan. 20.
 
He sent out a press release critical of the speech by President Barack Obama, as you would expect, but he also talked to me about what it was like to be there with every major political officeholder in the federal government, with the exception of one.  One member of the Cabinet is always kept in an undisclosed location.  In case something happens to everyone else, there will be someone to run the government.  In this case it was Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.
 
Walker said that the security presence in the Capitol, with the president, vice president, members of the Supreme Court, Cabinet secretaries and members of the House and Senate in attendance, was intense to say the least.
 
Walker said as he was looking around he realized that all those dignitaries were there in one room that was smaller than the worship center at Lawndale Baptist Church, where, before being elected to Congress, he was an associate pastor.
 
Walker said he was sitting to Obama's left about the second or third row back in the seats reserved for House members.
 
The Democrats seemed to jump up and clap every time the president paused to take a breath, and Walker said he didn't count but that he figured he stood and clapped about a dozen times in support of veterans, and the people in the room who were honored.  He said that regardless of political beliefs the room and the occasion command respect.
 
He said, ""The truth is it is still a privilege, no matter where you are politically, to be there in the room with all the political leaders.""
 
About the speech itself Walker said, ""I just felt like, historically, when you get handed that kind of loss in November, both in the Senate and the House, I would have expected a little bit more demeanor of ""let's work together.'""
 
Walker said, ""Who doesn't want to do everything for everybody, but you have to ask, how you are going to pay for it.""  And he added that you learn that ""Giving people more free stuff doesn't really help them in the long term.""
 
Walker's guest for the speech was not his wife or some big donor to his campaign, it was Alex Vance, who is from High Point and will be graduating from the US Capitol Police department on Friday.
 
In Walker's official press release he states, ""Tonight, President Obama demonstrated that he plans to continue to do more of the same, focusing [on] an outdated, top-down approach rather than working together with Congress to empower Americans and create opportunities for all."""
948618,Mt. Airy News - Local GOP officials: More of same from Obama,8,"By David Broyles

Tuesday's State Of The Union speech by President Barack Obama wasn't the call to work together some expected November's Democratic losses which gave Republicans control of both chambers of Congress.


Analysts have said at times Obama drew boundaries and cautioned against Republican overreach. The President left open the possibility of bipartisanship on issues such as trade but pushed an economic agenda of tax increases for the rich, expanded paid leave for workers and increased aid to education.


""At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,"" Obama said. ""Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.""


Proposals in the speech included raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for new tax credits for the working poor and the middle class and cost-free community college -- with an estimated cost of $60 billion over 10 years -- for any half-time student with a 2.5 GPA who was working towards a degree.


Locally, GOP leaders said there were no real surprises in his speech.


North Carolina Sixth District Rep. Mark Walker's response to the State of the Union address characterized it as ""more of the same. Focusing on an outdated, top-down approach rather than working together with Congress to empower Americans and create opportunities for all.""


""In November, the American people spoke against the President's policies, and I had high hopes he would listen to their voice and stop his unilateral executive overreach,"" Walker said. ""However, he has already issued six veto threats in the first two weeks of Congress and continues to push his own agenda over the will of the American people while doubling down on Washington bureaucracy and burdensome federal policies.


""The American people cannot afford more wasteful spending. Smaller government, lower taxes and less spending is the way to grow a healthy economy. Let's work on empowering Americans by reducing the bureaucracy and red tape in DC. I implore the President to work with Congress to achieve real reform and a better America.""


Surry County GOP Chairman Gary Tilley said so much of the speech had been released before Tuesday night, it left him feeling like someone telling how a football game turned out before you could watch it. He said the President's call for more taxes and more government was not what he thinks America needs.


""I feel that's not a path of prosperity for everyone,"" said Tilley. ""A rising tide lifts all boats and that's what we need. I fear we are getting into class warfare. He's trying to go down the road he's gone down before and not reaching across the aisle. I feel his foreign policy has led us to what amounts to a retreat globally. Frankly, Mitt Romney was right about Russia and China. It's no wonder the voters have buyer's remorse.""

949021,"The Columbus Dispatch - Kasich Plans Tax Cuts, More Aid to Poor in Upcoming Budget",8,"By Randy Ludlow

Ohioans will see a half-billion-dollar tax cut proposed when Gov. John Kasich unveils his two-year state budget proposal on Monday.

The Republican governor rolled out the first piece of his plan yesterday: eliminating state income taxes for 1 million small businesses, spurring them to reinvest and possibly create jobs, while also reducing income taxes for 3 million low-income and middle-class families.

And he wants the working poor to hang onto some state-subsidized child-care benefits longer instead of having them completely cut off as families make more money.

Follow @OhioPoliticsNow on Twitter

While most of Kasich's plan remains under wraps, it is expected to be touted as ""tax reform"" that raises some taxes while lowering the income tax in order to get to the net $500 million decrease. The income tax already has been chopped by about $3 billion since Kasich has been in office.

Kasich's sneak peek was embraced yesterday by those working to assist the poor.

Two standing ovations, and applause along the way, greeted the governor as he burnished his compassionate credo in remarks before the Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies' winter conference.

""He means what he says,"" said Phil Cole, executive director of the group. ""He's putting people first. The focus is on people, and I like that shift.""

The tax cuts for businesses and families would total nearly $1.1 billion over two years. Kasich did not say yesterday which taxes would be increased to offset those savings.But Scott Milburn, the governor's communication director, said Kasich would seek an increase in the cigarette tax. Advocates have suggested a jump of $1 per pack. Higher oil-and-gas drilling taxes and other increases also are likely to emerge.

The administration also is touting savings through efficiency, such as a 10 percent reduction in the state payroll in the past four years, as well as extra revenue from a growing state economy.

Small businesses with less than $2 million in annual gross receipts would pay no income taxes, and an increase in personal income-tax exemptions would leave many of the working poor tax-free, Kasich said.

Most of the governor's remarks, built atop his expansion of Medicaid to cover more than 450,000 additional low-income Ohioans, centered on public assistance and jobs for the needy.

The welfare system will become ""person-centered,"" he said, in a bid to stop dependency and joblessness from taking root in the young. People no longer will be ""widgets.""

He would spend $14 million over two years to pay for an income-based expansion of child-care subsidies to reward cash-assistance recipients working to overcome poverty.

Kasich wants to move more people off public assistance and into jobs, with an initial focus on those ages 16 to 24 to ""break the poverty cycle before it starts."" He would use $310 million a year in federal and state funds to help low-income people become self-sustaining.

Improved case management and an employment initiative by 2016 would focus on supporting at-risk youth, single parents, ex-felons and the homeless to help them begin work. Once the new setup for younger Ohioans has been in place for a year or so, it would be expanded to the state's entire welfare population.

Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, said, ""I think these are some of the boldest initiatives I have heard as it relates to transforming the current system."" She was excited by the focus on youth: ""By the time some of these kids get to 18, it's too late.""

Kasich took a hard line with county jobs-and-family-service agencies, saying they will have to meet higher expectations in achieving results for recipients or face having their funding transferred to a nonprofit agency, another county or the state.

""Those delivering it are interested in maintaining power or control, which leads to a government operation that cheats the taxpayer, and even more important, cheats the person who needs the help. This can't stand,"" he said.

Douglas Lumpkin, director of the state Office of Human Services Innovation, said counties ""agree with the concept"" of transforming assistance delivery. ""This will assure better outcomes for the individual and the family,"" he said.

Saying social services and government assistance for the needy are under attack, Kasich said he is making a stand for those willing to work to better themselves. He hopes lawmakers, many of them GOP conservatives, will agree.

""I'm beginning to see the rhetoric among my colleagues at the Statehouse changing a bit -- a little more concern, a little more softness, a little fewer hard edges,"" the governor said."
949026,"Cleveland.com - John Kasich to Propose Eliminating Income Tax on Most Small Businesses, Boost Exemptions for Low-, Middle-Income Ohioans",8,"By Robert Higgs

The budget proposal Gov. John Kasich will unveil Monday will include reforms that would eliminate state income tax on nearly all small businesses in Ohio and increase exemption levels for lower- and middle-income Ohioans.

Kasich revealed his plan in an appearance Thursday before a conference of the Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies. He also used the event to highlight initiatives in his budget that will help to lift the poor out of poverty and make Ohio's welfare programs operate more effectively.

His tax plans, touted as ""a comprehensive plan for helping all Ohioans share in our state's prosperity, call for:

Elimination of income tax from small businesses -- pass through entities such as sole proprietorships and S-corp. companies that report income on the owners' individual tax returns.

Increasing the personal exemption for Ohioans earning less than $40,000 a year from $2,200 to $4,000 in 2015.

Increasing the personal exemption for Ohioans earning $40,000 to $80,000 a year from $1,950 to $2,850.

The reform for small business is intended to bolster hiring possibilities. Small businesses provide employment for more than half of Ohio's workers.

The 100 percent income deduction would be available to all small businesses with annual gross receipts of $2 million or less. They still would be subject to Ohio's commercial activities tax, which corporations also pay.

For 2011, there were 970,570 tax filers with small businesses that had gross receipts of up to $2 million. The administration estimates that the tax elimination would cost Ohio about $696 million over the life of the two-year budget.

Ohio Tax Commissioner Joe Testa said about 98 percent of the businesses that report income as pass-through entities would qualify for the tax reduction.

""Small business is the element of job growth. ... It gives us the greatest promise for people to get to work,"" Kasich said.

""There's the butcher, there's the baker and there's the candlestick maker. There's the florist and the barber. Why do they matter?"" Kasich said. ""They matter because they are part of the glue that holds our communities together.""

The business tax relief will send a message, too, Kasich said.

""If you want to start a small business, do it in Ohio.""

Boosting the personal exemptions rewards work, Kasich said.

""You want to give incentives to people who go to work and you want them to have incentives to work even harder,"" Kasich said. ""So by doubling the personal exemption and combining it with the earned income tax credit, Ohio is beginning to give the people at the bottom the kind of  relief they need and the incentives to work more.""

For 2012, about 3.05 million Ohioans filed returns with up to $80,000 of tax liability, according to the administration.

Kasich did not take questions afterward. Testa, when asked how the tax packages would be paid for, said more details would be rolled out with the budget unveiling Monday.

The administration did say that the overall tax reform package in the budget will be a net cut of $500 million over the two years.

It's no secret, though, that Kasich continues to favor increasing the severance tax on oil and gas resources extracted from the ground. He also has favored boosting the per-pack tax on cigarettes.

Two years ago he proposed changes to Ohio's sales tax that would have broadened the base to include services. Legislators didn't go along with that plan, but increased the tax by a quarter of one-cent on goods purchases.

Ohio House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger and Senate President Keith Faber, both Republicans, said they were interested in the tax proposals, but wanted to see the details. They also said they would want the overall impact of all tax changes to be a net tax reduction.

That was the case in Kasich's previous budget proposals."
949028,"Cleveland.com - John Kasich's New Coordinated Welfare Approach to Start With Teens, Young Adults",8,"By Robert Higgs

Gov. John Kasich will propose new approaches for Ohio's welfare programs in the budget he unveils Monday, targeting teens and young adults as part of an effort to intervene at an early age to stop poverty.

The changes would require individual counties, which administer the assistance programs across the state, to designate a lead entity that will be responsible for coordinating help -- assistance programs and job training efforts -- and matching them to clients.

Individual clients would be able to one-stop shop with a caseworker who could connect them with assistance programs and job training needed to get them work.

The initial efforts would target people aged 16 to 24 with the idea of intervening before they get stuck in a cycle of poverty. Those clients would also have to take some personal responsibility,  participating in job training and be willing to help themselves.

The goal is to expand the approach to all Ohioans on public assistance by July 1, 2016.

Kasich has hinted that he intended to revamp the state's welfare approach. In a speech to the Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies on Thursday, he addressed tax changes he hopes will lead to more jobs, and he outlined his goals for public assistance.

""In our social service delivery system, there is no coordination,"" Kasich said. ""Here I get my food stamps. Here I get my child care. Here I get this. Here I get that. And I spend most of my time standing in line and not being treated.

""What we intend to do, and I believe it's imperative, is we want to tear down the silos,"" Kasich said.

The budget plan will allocate $310 million in state and federal funding toward a comprehensive case management system.

Ultimately, the goal is to provide ""more tools to help people who are stuck get unstuck,"" Kasich said.

While he discussed the new approach as one that will benefit individuals with the goal of lifting them out of poverty, he also issued a warning for the counties that administer the programs: Get on board or get left behind.

""We get this through, and I think we will, we're going to tell the commissioners (in Ohio's counties) that you will designate a lead agency and someone will be in charge of coordinating everything that involves the person in need,"" Kasich said. ""If counties do not do this, and they do not meet the metrics ... we are going to take every dime of TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) money out of that county and give it to a county that wants to do it, or we will privatize it or we will take it at the state level.""

Job training programs will coordinate with the business community so that the skills being taught can be applied jobs that exist, Kasich said. ""Not for underwater basket weaving.""

And he will propose increasing the income ceiling for assistance for child care from 200 to 300 percent of the poverty line in an effort to keep that cost from being a barrier to someone seeking work.

Ohio has made progress toward economic recovery in the last three years, Kasich said. New jobs are up. Unemployment is down.

""Good, but not good enough,"" he said. The next step is to help lift up those in poverty and address its causes.

""You can't look at that person as just a number or a widget,"" he said. ""You have to remember that you are in the process of rehabilitating a life."""
949067,The Monitor: Chemistry Between Abbott and RGV Grows,8,"By Unknown

It's altogether natural and perhaps fitting that society has a tendency to measure carefully each word and deed of new leaders once they assume the mantle of leadership.

That's why we are so encouraged by the recent visit of Gov. Greg Abbott to Edinburg last week to join in a significant announcement regarding a $2.8 million grant that the United Health Foundation gave to the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley Medical School to help provide health care for area colonias.

While everyone gathered at the Edinburg Conference Center at Renaissance was there to witness this historic grant announcement, there was an insightful moment when Abbott, our state's top elected official, spoke.

""As I was coming in,"" Abbott told the crowd of dignitaries, ""I had this recollection of a series of Texas history-making moments."" He went on to recall visiting the Valley -- at the very venue he was now speaking -- to participate in an historic gubernatorial debate that The Monitor had the honor of being a participant. He recalled that he chose to visit the Valley after being elected governor in November. And now, in his first trip outside of Austin after being sworn in as governor last week, he was back in the Valley. Beyond his own recollections, we recall that the Valley was his destination just a day after officially announcing his candidacy for governor.

At Abbott's level of politics, few things are happenstance. Whatever opinion we may have about the staging of candidates, we must realize that venue is a significant consideration.

So residents of the Valley, whatever their political preference, should acknowledge that our new governor has already invested a lot of political symbolism, if not hard campaign work, to develop political capital in our region. And we should be both appreciative and proud of the growing chemistry between Abbott and the Rio Grande Valley.

He made a commitment, as he so eloquently said last week, ""that I would shorten the distance between the Rio Grande Valley and the leadership in Austin.""

But the courtship is based on another factor, ""more important to you, is because of the important role that the Rio Grande Valley is playing in the future of the state of Texas.""

While many in the Valley have been demanding this type of political attention for years, we nonetheless should feel honored by it while recognizing that is carries with it a responsibility.

Our state's new chief executive is inviting the RGV to take a seat at the table of statewide influence and leadership not only because he is honoring a commitment he made to us, but because he recognizes the contribution this region can have to both the state and to his tenure in office.

We must acknowledge that Abbott continues to honor his commitment to the Valley while being mindful that we have a role to play in this relationship -- and he should be thanked.

We must recognize that if we are to accept his invitation at this table of influence, we should come with our own sense of commitment. It's a commitment borne of a moral obligation to be active citizens of the state and borne of the knowledge that our region does indeed have something special to offer."
949283,USA Today - Bipartisan Bill Could Break Highway Funding Gridlock,8,"By Deirdre Shesgreen

A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working on legislation supporters say would solve one of Washington's most vexing problems: how to pay for the nation's massive infrastructure needs without raising taxes.

The legislation is still a work in progress. But the broad outlines call for giving U.S. corporations a tax break on profits earned overseas -- bringing much of that money back to the U.S. and raising an estimated $170 billion in new revenue.

Lawmakers want to use $120 billion of that windfall to shore up the nearly empty Highway Trust Fund for the next six years and direct another $50 billion to the creation of an American Infrastructure Fund. That account would provide loans and other financing tools to states and cities for a gamut of infrastructure projects, from sewer improvements to broadband access.

""There is $2 trillion of stranded profits overseas,"" Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said Wednesday. ""Infrastructure is an appealing way from all points of this discussion to encourage that money to come back, and it would allow us to look at a 5- or 6-year highway bill, which is what we need to do if we want to get serious"" about fixing the nation's roads and highways.

The idea is already gaining traction among Republican leaders in Congress, with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., both endorsing the general concept of using international tax reform to fund infrastructure. It has attracted the attention of the White House as well.

Blunt is in talks with a small group of House and Senate lawmakers on the measure, led by Rep. John Delaney, a Maryland Democrat. Blunt and Delaney sponsored a narrower version of the proposal in the last Congress, but it only raised money to create the infrastructure bank and did not address the shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund.

Delaney is pushing for a broader bill in this Congress, noting that the highway fund will run dry at the end of May. The revenue flowing into the fund, which comes from federal gas taxes, isn't enough to cover current highway spending.

In the past few years, lawmakers have failed to agree on a long-term fix to shore up the fund, instead passing dozens of short-term highway bills with essentially flat funding and paid for with budget gimmicks.

Delaney and Blunt said Wednesday this new proposal could be a way to break the political gridlock and pave the way for passage of a multiyear highway bill --something state transportation directors have been clamoring for. But it's a complex proposal with many moving parts -- and it's being floated in a new Congress where GOP leaders are still adjusting to having full control of the legislative levers.

Under current tax law, U.S.-based corporations with foreign subsidiaries are taxed on profits earned in the U.S. and overseas. But they can defer payments on the foreign earnings until they ""repatriate"" those profits by bringing the money back into the U.S. That provides an incentive for companies to keep the money offshore.

In 2014, more than 300 U.S.-based companies held about $1.95 trillion in profits overseas, according to an analysis by Bloomberg. That's a politically appealing pot of revenue at a time when lawmakers in both parties want to increase spending on infrastructure but no one wants to increase taxes.

Delaney's proposal would deem those overseas profits repatriated -- regardless of whether U.S. companies bring the money back to the U.S. Rather than tax the money at the standard U.S. corporate rate of 35%, however, those multinational firms would pay 8.75% on their foreign earnings.

Delaney says that would raise about $170 billion -- enough, he says, to fill the trust fund for six years and give states a 20% increase in federal money for highways and bridges over that period.

""It's a real plus-up for our infrastructure investment,"" he said Wednesday.

Blunt said the other element of the proposal -- putting $50 billion toward an infrastructure bank -- could also be a boon for states, providing a new financing tool for a wide range of infrastructure projects.

""If Springfield (Mo.) wanted to focus on improvements to broadband or energy infrastructure, they could do that using this fund,"" he said. It would turn ""stranded"" corporate profits into ""seed capital for an infrastructure fund that would be broad-based.""

Blunt said he is looking at Delaney's expanded proposal and trying to make sure it's something he's ""comfortable with"" and to verify that ""the numbers work.""

""I think they will,"" Blunt said. ""We're trying to figure out a way to move forward.""

Transportation experts say the idea is not perfect. For one thing, the trust fund would be broke again in six years.

""Ideally you would want to create a consistent funding source for surface transportation so we know we will be investing for the long haul,"" said Joshua Schank, president and CEO of the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington.

He also questioned whether the money would stretch for as long as Delaney says. Despite those reservations, Schank said it may be the ""best worst option"" as GOP leaders scramble to pass a new bill before the trust fund goes belly up at the end of May.

Delaney echoed that point -- saying this proposal will take flight because ""there's a total absence of other ideas to deal with this.""

In that vacuum, he said, ""There's a tremendous amount of momentum  converging around this idea."""
949284,St. Louis Post-Dispatch - Blunt Leading Republicans On Immigration Fight,8,"The Senate is girding for a fight on immigration, with Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt leading Republican efforts to cut funding for President Barack Obama's 2014 executive order easing pathway to citizenship for millions of Americans.

""This is an important fight to have,"" Blunt, R-Mo., said Tuesday, as GOP leaders announced they would take up for Senate deliberation a House bill that passed earlier this month designed to ax funding for Obama's controversial order.

Republicans face a steep uphill battle to pass it in the Senate. If all 54 Senate Republicans stick together, they'll need at least six Democrats to proceed with them in order to force a vote on a bill extending funding of the Department of Homeland Security. 

On Tuesday, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who has been among Democrats siding with Republicans this session on the Keystone XL Pipeline, was among 41 Democrat Senators signing a letter calling for a clean vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security. That alone is a number sufficient to be a parliamentary block on Blunt's plans. 

In spending deals made last year, Republicans managed to put off longer-term funding of the department to have this battle over Obama's immigration order, now that they have taken control of the Senate.

The president, and his Democrat allies in the Congress, have said he has the authority to take the actions he did in November, which included expanding those eligible for citizenship and deferring deportation and other action on other groups. Opponents decried it as amnesty and an illegal presidential usurpation of Congress, and say no paths to citizenship for those here illegally should come before border security with Mexico is strengthened.

House Speaker John Boehner reportedly told his caucus Tuesday that he was preparing to sue Obama over the issue.
By Chuck Raasch

Bowing to Senate conservatives, some of whom have railed against Obama's actions while testing possible 2016 presidential runs, GOP leaders have announced they will take up the House-passed bill. But it will take 60 votes, under Senate rules, to force the issue to a vote.

Blunt said that ""we should do everything we can to persuade a half dozen Democrats that they should join us to get this done.

""Sometimes you don't know how legislative battles will go until you have them, and we intend to have this one,"" he said. 

Last month, Blunt joined an amicus brief by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and John Cornyn, R-Texas, supporting a state of Texas lawsuit against Obama's order. 

Democrats accused Republicans of jeopardizing national security by tying DHS funding to the immigration fight.

""In light of recent events in Paris, Ottawa and Australia, the threat of ISIS and the proliferation of foreign fighters that return home radicalized, DHS funding should not be tied to divisive political issues that could jeopardize this critical funding,"" said the letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. It was also signed by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.

Durbin has been among those most strongly urging Obama to use executive actions to push immigration reforms the President wants. Durbin was among a handful of senators who wrote Obama in November urging the President ""to use your well-established executive authority to improve as much of the immigration system as you can."""
949378,Capital Journal - All business on First Day for Rounds,8,"By Joel Ebert

As Republicans officially took control of Congress on Tuesday, South Dakota's newest senator was ready for the pomp and circumstance to be over so the real work could begin.

""We're going to try to hit the ground running,"" Sen. Mike Rounds of Pierre said while sitting inside his sparsely decorated temporary office located next door to the Capitol.

With the halls of the Capitol filled with journalists, eager politicians and small armies of family members, Rounds was joined by his own family as he took part in Tuesday's ceremonial swearing in.

Rounds' day was filled with both business and celebration as he officially joined the 114th Congress.

As many as 21 members of Rounds' family, including his father, Don, traveled to Washington, D.C., to see the former governor be sworn in as the junior senator from South Dakota. The group posed for a photo opportunity with Vice President Joe Biden after Rounds ceremoniously took the oath of office while standing next to his wife, Jean, who held his Bible.

After the swearing in, Rounds headed to a committee meeting in hopes of getting down to business.

""It's only day one,"" Rounds said. ""I think the former members that are still here are very serious about changing the way we do business in the Senate.""
That will likely include some lively debates on issues on the Senate floor.
""We'll have some real disagreements,"" Rounds said.

One issue that Republicans have been pushing has been the passage of the TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline. The party has made it clear the 1,179-mile oil pipeline is a top priority, and both the House and the Senate are set to discuss the oil pipeline this week.

Rounds, who signed on as a sponsor to the bill, called the pipeline legislation a ""jobs bill"" that he would like to see passed this session. But even as members of the new Congress were still being sworn in, the legislation took a hit when the White House said the president would not sign the bill if passed by both chambers.

Prior to President Barack&#8197;Obama's announcement, Rounds had said the president could go one of two ways.

He could decide that the political fight that could take place would not be worth it or he could actually engage.

""If he vetoes it, he puts Democrats at risk, because we will likely bring it to a vote.""

Rounds said bringing it to a vote would be fine. He believes the XL pipeline has popular support throughout the country.

""Democrats will have to either say we're going to stand behind the president's veto and then go back home and defend it or they may abandon him,"" he said.

Beyond the XL pipeline, Rounds said Congress is set to discuss a number of issues including the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank and the Environmental Protection Agency.

""We've got a whole series of overreach issues that I think the new majority in the U.S. Senate has an interest in addressing.""

While thinking about his current transition from being a former governor to a current U.S. senator, Rounds said it hasn't quite hit him yet but he's sure it will come soon.

""There's an excitement in the air right now. It'll hit me more as my family heads home and as we get down to the day-to-day grind that this can become. I don't have any expectations that it's all going to be fun, but I think it's the place where the action's at right now and we'll make the best of it.""

Rounds said he is well aware of the fact that not many people get to serve in the Senate and he is fully invested in using the office in the way that it was intended.

""Which is to get things done,"" he added.

Rounds said he will use skills he learned as majority leader of the South Dakota Senate. ""You bring your team with you and develop a consensus. If you do that, you can get some things accomplished.""

While making no promises as to how productive the 114th Congress will be, Rounds said it will become evident in the days and months ahead.

""Time will tell if we are successful or not. But we know the way they did it last time around did not work. It's time to go back to finding areas of agreement for a while, while at the same time maintaining a protection of our principles."""
949383,Argus Leader - Mike Rounds Officially Joins the Senate,8,"by Christopher Doering

Former Gov. Mike Rounds was sworn in to the Senate on Tuesday and said he is eager to begin his work as a senator and ""get results.""

Rounds, sporting a black and red-striped tie and his customary yellow ribbon with an American flag lapel pin on his black suit, was escorted in the Senate by fellow South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune and retiring Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson, whom he is replacing. A smiling Rounds stood on the Senate floor about 11:30 a.m. Central time, his left hand clutching his wife Jean's Bible and his right hand held in the air as he took the oath from Vice President Joe Biden.

""I'm ready to get started. It's been a long lead-up. We've been working at it for two years to convince voters that we're the right thing to do,"" Rounds said in an interview. ""And now they've put their faith in us and we want to follow through, we want to get results. We're going to enjoy the day, but we're also going to keep the perspective that nothing has happened yet. We haven't accomplished anything yet.""

The House also swore-in all of its members Tuesday, including Republican Rep. Kristi Noem who was elected last November to a third term.

Rounds' ascension to Washington helped Republicans take control of the Senate. Along with their majority in the House, it is the first time in eight years the GOP has controlled both chambers. Rounds, from Huron, is only the 27th person to represent South Dakota in the Senate.

He began the day eating breakfast with his family at a hotel, then headed to the Capitol for interviews, meetings and to take the oath of office.

During a ceremonial swearing-in photo opportunity in the old Senate chamber later Tuesday, Rounds, 60, stood next to his family and Biden. The vice president introduced himself, shook hands and gave Rounds some pointers on where to stand and hold his Bible. ""Hey, Gov., good to see you, man,"" a jovial Biden told Rounds. ""I enjoyed working with you when you were governor, and I'm looking forward to working with you now.""

As the pomp and circumstance of the first day fades, lawmakers have a daunting list of issues they are expected to tackle, from the Keystone XL pipeline and taxes to transportation and the Affordable Care Act. Among the first items on his agenda, Rounds has agreed to sponsor a bill that would allow construction of the 1,200-mile Keystone pipeline. The White House made it clear Tuesday that President Obama will not sign a bill authorizing the pipeline.

Thune, now the longest-serving senator from South Dakota, called Rounds a ""solid, proven leader who will bring South Dakota common sense to the Senate.""

Rounds said his time as a governor and 10 years in the South Dakota Legislature have taught him that local government often is better able to meet the needs of people than the federal government.

""It seems that over the last couple of years we've gone to the point where the federal government has their finger in everything, and maybe it's time we take different approach and allow local governments to make more decisions on their own,"" he said.

Rounds will spend the next few weeks in Washington adjusting to the Senate's peculiar traditions and formalities, and awaiting a permanent location for his office this spring or summer, based on seniority. He'll most likely be ranked 96th in seniority out of 100 senators. For now, he's operating out of a temporary office in the Russell Senate Office Building.

Rounds, the oldest of 11 children, said he plans to commute between Washington and South Dakota weekly, if possible. He celebrated his swearing in at a reception with family and friends."
949460,Politico - The Plot to Overhaul No Child Left Behind,8,"By Maggie Severns

Republicans are hatching an ambitious plan to rewrite No Child Left Behind this year -- one that could end up dramatically rolling back the federal role in education and trigger national blowouts over standardized tests and teacher training.

NCLB cleared Congress in 2002 with massive bipartisan support but has since become a political catastrophe: The law's strategy for prodding and shaming schools into improvement proved deeply flawed over time, and its unintended failures have eclipsed its bright spots. Today, NCLB is despised by some parents who blame it for schools ""teaching to the test,"" protested by some on the left for promoting education reform and reviled by Republicans in Congress who say the law represents aggressive federal overreach.

Now Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. John Kline of Minnesota, who will lead the Senate and House education committees, are planning to push an overhaul of NCLB at a moment when backlash in the states has reached an all-time high, opening up new political windows to strip the federal role out of education.

The push to rewrite the country's main K-12 education law will be ""all about Congress taking a red pen and deleting"" language, said Mike Petrilli, president of the conservative Thomas B. Fordham Institute and a former Education Department staffer.

Alexander spent December huddling with lawmakers, including Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the committee's forthcoming ranking member, to begin hammering out a strategy for a bill that could clear the Senate's 60-vote threshold. He's said he wants a bill on the president's desk before summer.

The president may be hard-pressed to veto even a very conservative bill, though the administration has signaled in the past it will take a hard line when it comes to preserving annual tests and other provisions that focus on equal access to education in NCLB. The Obama administration ushered in what has been labeled a dismantling of the law by giving states huge leeway on some of its key provisions, but the so-called waiver policy is unpopular in the states in no small part because it helped encourage the proliferation of the Common Core standards.

Lobbyists swarmed Capitol Hill in December to sway lawmakers' positions in chaotic education debates over how often to test students and what role -- if any -- school vouchers should have in the law. These debates are set to erupt in January, though some groups have put themselves ahead of the curve: The National Education Association, the country's largest teacher's union, has been pushing to roll back testing requirements for years and is seizing on recent anti-testing sentiment in the states to make a fresh case for getting rid of annual tests on Capitol Hill.

Part of the difficulty in rewriting the law is that the most hated parts of the bill are deeply intertwined with its heralded civil rights provisions: The testing requirements, for example, allowed the government for the first time to spotlight the achievement gaps between white students from higher-income families and their peers when those test results were broken down by race and socioeconomic status. NCLB put a public spotlight on schools and districts that were falling flat when it comes to helping disadvantaged students -- and pressed them to improve when no one else would.

Civil rights groups say they were caught a little off guard by the sudden resurgence of debate over this aspect of NCLB. They fear Congress will strip core provisions of the law but hope that the national conversation about race sparked by recent events in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City will help keep a spotlight on civil rights.

Rep. George Miller, the outgoing ranking member of the House education committee and an original author of NCLB, said he anticipates the business and civil rights communities will rein in lawmakers when it comes to keeping the law's testing and accountability requirements.

""There's no future for the NEA in being anti-civil rights for poor and minority children. Historically, that's never been their position,"" Miller said.

The long road to reauthorization

The education world has come a long way since former President George W. Bush pulled together a cadre of education lawmakers -- Sens. Ted Kennedy and Judd Gregg and Reps. John Boehner and George Miller -- to pass NCLB. The bill expanded and reshaped the federal role in education, requiring states for the first time to annually test students who are in third grade through eighth grade in reading and math. And it put in place new requirements for teachers as well as a host of reform options for schools that weren't holding up their ends of the bargain.

The bill's bipartisan support has sometimes been credited to the burst of patriotism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that surrounded its passage in Congress. (The president even gave Miller a nickname: Big George.)

But within a year, Democrats were criticizing Bush for proposing too little funding to implement the law, and several lawsuits followed. By the time NCLB expired in 2007, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle felt it needed changes, though many still stood by its original intent.

That year, lawmakers argued about putting more into the bill to strengthen accountability. But from 2007 to 2014, there were drastic changes in the political landscape: The tea party moved politics at large to the right, and Obamacare ignited concerns about federal overreach across the government. The education debate changed, too: A cheating scandal in Atlanta public schools in 2009 raised questions about how high-stakes testing was affecting schools. And Diane Ravitch -- a long-time advocate for the law and former Education Department official -- abruptly flipped sides, saying NCLB had been a mistake, and subsequently rose to prominence on the left as an advocate for teachers and overturning the law.

A flurry of proposals to rewrite NCLB in 2007 went nowhere, the same fate as a 2010 White House blueprint for reforming the law. A year later, Senate education committee leaders struck a deal on a bipartisan NCLB overhaul -- but it included unpopular compromises that held it back in the Senate and garnered little support from the House. It never got a floor vote.

By the time the 2012 elections moved into full swing, the Obama administration was issuing waivers to states exempting them from the most punitive parts of NCLB in exchange for sketching out their own state plans for improving teacher quality, academic standards and creating better accountability systems.

""The waivers opened a pressure valve"" that allowed members of Congress to delay rewriting the law, said Noelle Ellerson, associate executive director at AASA, the School Superintendents Association. Waiver provisions could stretch into the administration.

By 2013, bipartisanship had evaporated, and Republicans and Democrats each had their own proposals for overhauling the law. Kline and Alexander, who was ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee at the time, each had draft bills that stood in opposition to Senate Democrats' proposals, and the House passed Kline's bill in the summer of 2013 along party lines. It was dead on arrival in the Democratic Senate.

Now the draft bills released by Kline and Alexander have become starting points for next year's NCLB push, and the White House may be forced to stake out new positions on the bill. Education Secretary Arne Duncan has said the administration can't support any bill that turns back annual tests -- and some Hill watchers familiar with the department expect him to stick with that policy.

The great testing debate

Considering Congress has spent seven years trying to rewrite NCLB, the debate over reauthorization is still plenty chaotic.

Because of congressional turnover and changing politics, some key lawmakers are undecided on big issues. The blowout controversies in NCLB actually amount to only a handful of sections in the 600-plus page law: when and how to test students, how to punish low-performing schools -- if at all -- and what the law should do to promote good teaching. A host of other critical provisions, like the formula used to allocate money to school districts that serve low-income children, are badly in need of updating but haven't been touched in years.

Alexander said he'll hold a hearing on testing soon after Congress returns from recess.

He and Kline have said they're open to scaling back annual testing, though some suspect they're capitalizing on the chance to grab hold of an issue they can use as a bargaining chip down the line.

Anti-testing advocates say tests cut into instructional time, forcing teachers to teach only tested content and taking creativity out of learning for students. They see a number of solutions: Students could be tested every other year or a handful of times throughout their school careers, or a sample of students could be tested rather than an entire class.

But experts say it would become difficult to calculate the effect a teacher has on students' test scores, which education reformers see as a key measure of quality teaching. It would also become impossible to track how students progress from grade to grade and take reams of data out of the pool that researchers use to study schools, said Morgan Polikoff, an assistant education professor at the University of Southern California's Rossier School of Education.

The problem, Polikoff noted, is that these arguments for keeping tests don't appeal to parents or the public.

For the civil rights community, collecting annual data allows parents to know how their children are doing, and to an extent, just having the data public can shame schools into doing better.

""We see this as a civil rights bill,"" said Nancy Zirkin, executive vice president for the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

""I am hard-pressed to understand how you give states federal money with no strings attached,"" Zirkin said.

One key player the anti-testing crowd is looking to sway: Murray, a former teacher and union ally whom representatives for school groups hope will be open to their pleas.

Murray was quiet about her position this fall. She has said she's willing to work with Republicans on a bill but emphasized she won't overcompromise. A Democratic Senate aide said the senator opposes ""overly burdensome testing requirements"" but declined to say where Murray will land on the issue, and many suspect she'll reflect the views of outgoing Senate education committee leader Sen. Tom Harkin, a proponent of tests and accountability.

Murray's counterpart in the House, Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, is also new to committee leadership. Scott was clear in an interview that he sees value in tests that report results broken down by race and other subgroups.

""One of the strongest parts of No Child Left Behind is the fact that the testing exposes systems that are not working,"" Scott said, adding that using tests well and not over-testing students is important. Other committee Democrats hope the conversation will be more moderate going forward. Oregon Rep. Suzanne Bonamici introduced a bill in September that would encourage states to eliminate redundant tests that Democrats hoped would jump-start a more nuanced conversation.

The Post-NCLB Congress

With Miller's retirement, Boehner is the only original author of NCLB still serving in Congress. Boehner has few loyalties to the original law, though he remains a supporter of school choice.

Education advocates see two reasons to think Congress will play for keeps this time: new leadership and discontented constituents. They see both Alexander and Murray as skilled, experienced leaders who care deeply about education. Alexander has been in ""deep conversations"" with Senate education committee Democrats, a GOP aide said. And he's stalwart in his belief that taking the bill through an open amendment process in committee and on the Senate floor will give the best possible chance of the Senate producing a bipartisan bill.

But he also knows he'll need only a handful of Democrats in the Senate, and he can get some, if not all, of them by recruiting Democratic senators with backgrounds in state politics, such as Colorado's Michael Bennet, an Alexander ally on the committee. The goal is to pass a bill out of committee in February, the aide said.

Even with that fast timeline, the 2016 elections will loom heavily over the debate, said Lindsay Jones, director of public policy at the National Center for Learning Disabilities.

""The megaphone that gets given to people who are going to run for president will be given very quickly,"" Jones said. Senators who are expected to announce bids for the Republican nomination, from Rand Paul to Rob Portman, have been vocal on education in the past.

Petrilli has high hopes that Congress can get further along in rewriting NCLB but thinks eventually Republicans will have to decide whether they can come to an agreement with the White House.

Alternatively, they could pass a hard-line conservative rewrite of NCLB and reap the political points as the 2016 elections move into full swing.

That's the most likely outcome, Petrilli said: The president vetoes a long-awaited rewrite of NCLB, ""and Republicans have a bill that they could run on."""
949464,"The Daily Times - Alexander Seeks Final Repayment for State, Counties, Reopening Smokies Park in 2013 Shutdown",8,"By Joel Davis

Blount County could get back the last $6,010 of the money it contributed to reopening Great Smoky Mountains National Park during the 2013 government shutdown back if a bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander passes.

On Monday, Alexander, R-Tenn., co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., to reimburse states that provided their own funds to keep the national parks in their state open during the federal government shutdown.

""The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is one of America's greatest treasures, which was forced to be shut down during its prime tourist season, a time when the park welcomes the most visitors and the surrounding businesses make most of their money,"" Alexander said. ""This legislation would help relieve the pain caused in these areas and their surrounding communities and ensure Tennessee taxpayers won't have to pay the price for keeping them open.""

The National Park Access Act would reimburse the six states (Arizona, 
Colorado, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah) that paid the National Park Service approximately $2 million of state and local money to keep the national parks in their states open during the federal government shutdown.

Blount County has already been refunded $24,040 of the $30,050 it contributed to reopening GSMNP. The state had paid 80 percent of the total cost of opening the Park in the form of a $240,400 tourism grant to Sevier County, with Sevier and Blount counties splitting the remaining $60,100. Only one day's worth of funds were actually needed.

Officials previously said that Blount County would get the remaining money back one way or another. Private donations were offered to reimburse the county if no legislative fix occurs.

GSMNP cost about $60,100 to operate per day in 2013, according to the National Park Service. The partners ended up paying for operations on Oct. 16, 2013, the last day of the government shutdown.

During the government shutdown, Alexander introduced similar legislation, The Protecting States, Opening National Parks Act, to reimburse states within 90 days for all state funds used to reopen national parks while the federal government was shut down.

The legislation gives the National Park Service the congressional authority it needs to pay back states from $2 million in retroactive funding approved when the shutdown ended in 2013."
949467,"Knoxville News Sentinel - Alexander Bill Returns School Testing, Accountability Decisions to States",8,"By Michael Collins

The federal government's involvement in student testing and school accountability would be greatly curtailed under draft legislation U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander is circulating as a starting point for fixing the Bush-era No Child Left Behind school-reform law.

States would be required to set high standards to measure student achievement, but the federal government could not dictate what those standards would be or require states to submit their standards for review or approval.

Public schools would no longer have to conform to a federal mandate of yearly progress, but states would have to establish accountability systems to measure whether schools are meeting prescribed standards.

The goal of the bill, to be called the Every Child Ready for College or Career Act, is to put more decisions about schools back in the hands of state and local communities, said Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who is the new chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

""We've had a trend toward a national school board, and we need to reverse that trend and put responsibility back to states and local school districts,"" Alexander said Tuesday in a speech from the Senate floor.

Alexander has made fixing the landmark No Child Left Behind law his top priority as the committee chairman. To drive home that point, the committee's first hearing under his leadership will be next Wednesday and will focus on school testing and accountability.

""I'm ready to get started,"" Alexander said.

No Child Left Behind, the landmark school-reform law enacted with bipartisan support in 2001 under then-President George W. Bush, sought to hold schools accountable for student performance and get better-qualified teachers in classrooms. The law mandated that schools set academic standards and test students annually in reading and math while they are in grades three through eight and once while they are in high school. All students also must be tested periodically in science.

Test results are then used to determine whether schools are making adequate yearly progress. Those that aren't are considered ""failing"" and can face severe consequences, including closure or replacing staff.

Critics have long argued that the law is too punitive, places so much emphasis on reading and math scores that other subjects are given short shrift, and doesn't take into account that some schools may fall short because of a handful of low-performing students.

Since 2012, the Obama administration has issued waivers to 42 states to let them avoid some of the law's more stringent requirements. In return for those waivers, the administration has required states to adopt certain standards, such as Common Core.

Alexander said it's clear the law is no longer working. But the fundamental question that must be answered in revising the law ""is to what extent the federal government should be telling states and local districts what they should be doing in their schools,"" he said.

""I believe states should set their own academic standards,"" Alexander said. ""In my opinion, the federal government should be prohibited from telling Tennessee or any other state what its academic standards should be. If Tennessee wants Common Core, it should have it. If it doesn't want it, it shouldn't have it.""

In a speech Monday in Washington, Education Secretary Arne Duncan called No Child Left Behind ""tired and prescriptive."" But he said any revision of the law should continue to include mandatory testing.

Alexander , who served as education secretary under President George H.W. Bush, said he's not ready to decide whether the existing tests should be scrapped. But, ""I want to ask the question,"" he said. ""I want to learn from those outside the Senate: Should we keep the same tests or give states more flexibility?""

Under Alexander's draft bill, the federal government would still support states and local school districts in fixing schools that are the lowest performing. States and local school districts would be encouraged to set up teacher and principal evaluation systems, but the federal government could not dictate or be involved in the design of those systems.

More than 60 programs under No Child Left Behind would be consolidated and streamlined, and those that are duplicative would be eliminated. States also would be encouraged to create and expand charter schools."
949470,The Hill - GOP Senator: O-Care's Employer Mandate Would Lower US Work Ethic,8,"By Tim Devaney

A top Senate Republican says lowering the definition of a full-time employee to anyone who works 30 hours or more per week would lower the nation's work ethic.

""It is a strange definition -- one that sounds more like France than the United States,"" Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said Thursday during a hearing.

At issue is a provision of ObamaCare known as the employer mandate that would require businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to provide health insurance for those workers.
ObamaCare defines ""full-time"" as 30 hours per week, so that more employees are covered.

Democrats say this is a much-needed protection for workers.

But Republicans argue this will provide businesses with an incentive to cut workers' hours below 30.

Alexander pointed to a study that says 2.6 million workers could have their hours cut, or even lose their jobs, under the changes.

""Many businesses can't afford ObamaCare's mandate and must reduce their number of full-time employees,"" the Tennessee Republican said. ""The result of all this is that thousands of workers are getting a pay cut. Their work schedules are being reduced to 29 hours a week and below.""

House Republicans two weeks ago passed a measure that would restore the definition to 40 hours per week and waive the penalties for companies that do not offer health insurance to employees working fewer than 40 hours per week.

The Senate is now considering similar legislation introduced by Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.).

Alexander said Thursday he hopes it will ""repair the damage of ObamaCare.""

But the top Democrat on the Health Committee, Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.),  said hundreds of thousands of workers would lose access to health insurance if Republicans succeed in changing the definition to 40 hours per week.

""They shouldn't have to worry about their healthcare coverage being threatened,"" Murray said. ""We should be rewarding hard work, not punishing it."""
949473,Times Free Press - Tennessee's Lamar Alexander Off and Running in New U.S. Senate,8,"By Unknown

U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., is among 22 Senate sponsors of the American Liberty Restoration Act, S. 203, a bill that repeals the requirement in the Affordable Care Act that requires people to have insurance.

""How can we continue to enforce the individual mandate when the law doesn't clearly ensure that millions of Americans are allowed to receive subsidies to help cover the cost?"" Alexander said in a statement. ""How can we enforce it when Obamacare outlaws plans that fit family budgets? Millions more Americans are in for sticker shock when they see how much they owe the IRS in April because of Obamacare. We need to focus on making health care plans affordable to Americans,"" said Alexander.

He was referring to a provision that people who received subsidies for health insurance must report the amounts on their income tax returns, and those who earned more than estimated will have to repay some or all of their subsidies.

At his first hearing as chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Alexander called for passage of a bipartisan bill to fix No Child Left Behind by the end of February.

Saying reform is years overdue, Alexander added, ""At the center of the debate about how to fix No Child Left Behind is what to do about the federal requirement that states annually administer 17 standardized tests with high-stakes consequences. Educators call this an accountability system. Are there too many tests? Are they the right tests? Are the stakes for failing them too high? What should Washington, D.C., have to do with all this?""

Alexander also was elected chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development."
949478,Chattanooga Times Free Press - Lamar Alexander Blasts Corps for Not Funding New Chickamauga Lock in Budget,8,"By Dave Flessner

The new chairman of the U.S. Senate panel that oversees the America's waterways today chided the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for not allocating any money in its proposed budget next year for the stalled Chickamauga Lock in Chattanooga.

U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who took over last month as chairman of the Senate's Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, said the fuel tax increase imposed on barge operators and the change in the Inland Waterways Trust Funding formula should provide enough money to restart work on the new lock at the Chickamauga Dam.

""Congress has done its jobs and it's disappointing that the adminstration has failed to do its job,"" Alexander told officials of the Corps of Engineers. ""We're almost out of time for a solution.""

Alexander said the replacement lock is needed at the Chickamauaga Dam to replace the aging, 75-year-old lock that suffers from ""concrete growth"" and may have to be permanently shut down within the next five to 10 years.

Such a closure could add another 175,000 cars on to Interstate 75 and boost the shipping costs for manufacturers and other businesses and government facilities in East Tennessee.

The White House budget for fiscal 2016 for the Corps of Engineers released earlier this month is 13.4 percent less than what Congress allocated for the Corps in 2015.

The criticism of the Corps' budget today came from both sides of the partisan aisle.

""It's not acceptable when we consider all of the water resource needs of our country,"" said U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, R-Calif., the ranking member of the subcommittee."
949574,Citizen Times - Mark Meadows Trying Again on Federal Worker Porn Ban,8,"By Mark Barrett

Eleventh District U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows is trying again with a bill to make it clear that federal employees are not allowed to view pornography on the job.

Meadows, a Jackson County Republican, on Wednesday introduced a bill to prohibit federal workers from accessing pornographic or explicit material on government computers or devices.

He introduced a similar measure last September, late in the congressional calendar, that went nowhere. Meadows said the move was prompted by a case described in a May 2014 committee meeting of an EPA employee found to have spent as much as six hours a day looking at porn on the job using his work computer who was suspended with pay but had yet to be dismissed months later.

Meadows' office said similar cases have surfaced since then.

""It's appalling that it requires an act of Congress to ensure that federal agencies block access to these sites,"" Meadows said in a statement.

""While there are rules in place at most agencies to ban this kind of unprofessional and potentially hostile workplace behavior, it continues to take place. There is absolutely no excuse for federal employees to be viewing and downloading pornographic materials on the taxpayers' dime,"" he said.

It appeared last year that the EPA worker was still on the job not because there was no policy preventing the actions, but because firing someone at the agency for any reason is a complicated process.

Many federal agencies explicitly ban the practice, and an EPA policy says workers can be fired for using government equipment to look at ""materials that are sexually explicit or sexually oriented."""
949575,rollcall.com - Bowser Talks Metro and Marijuana on Capitol Hill,8,"By Bridget Bowman

Two weeks after meeting with Speaker John A. Boehner, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser was back on Capitol Hill Thursday to meet with Democratic leaders and others to discuss D.C. issues, including Metro funding, marijuana legalization and autonomy.

Bowser told CQ Roll Call after her discussion with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that the meetings were part of an ongoing effort to foster relationships on Capitol Hill. She also met with Assistant Democratic Leader James E. Clyburn, D-S.C. and the leaders of the Oversight subcommittee with jurisdiction over D.C. ""Our focus has been on creating new relationships between the mayor and members of the Congress,"" Bowser said. ""And so I just wanted to let Leader Pelosi know that our door is open.""

Bowser said she asked Pelosi to ""keep an eye on"" funding for  the Department of Homeland Security's move to the St. Elizabeth's hospital site in Southeast D.C. They also discussed the District's marijuana legalization initiative, which faces an uncertain future with GOP opposition in Congress, and funding for the Metro.

When asked what Pelosi said during their discussion of the marijuana initiative, Bowser responded, ""Her concern is that residents of the District of Columbia should enjoy the rights that every other American has. And that their elected leaders and and voters should pass laws that affect the residents of the District of Columbia, without intrusion by the Congress.""

Bowser also discussed funding for the D.C. Metro system, an issue that came to the forefront this week after the Washington Area Metro Transit Authority released its proposed 2016 budget Monday, revealing that Metro faces a funding gap. In the budget, WMATA proposed a fare increase of up to 10 cents and cuts in late-night services and some bus services to make up for the shortfall.

Following WMATA's announcement, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said she would introduce a bill to restore parity between transit benefits and parking benefits. Norton said a reduction of transit benefits led to a 25 percent decrease in D.C. Metro ridership. On Thursday, Bowser, said she raised the issue with Pelosi.

""The federal government, of course, is a big user of our Metro system,"" Bowser said. ""Transit parity is one way to get there but ultimately there will be capital needs as well.""

Bowser also discussed the Metro system with leaders of the House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Operations, which has jurisdiction over D.C. issues. The committee's chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said their discussion focused mainly on Metro safety. The subcommittee is holding a hearing on Metro safety on Friday.

""I think most of it is really trying to just make sure that the Metro that all of us depend on operates efficiently and safely,"" Meadows said. ""And [Bowser] did mention that there's a lot of deferred maintenance that she believes needs to be addressed. And so we've agreed to certainly take a real strong look at all of those issues.""

Metro safety issues also made headlines this week, after the National Transportation Safety Board issued ""urgent recommendations"" Wednesday for improving Metro's ventilation system following a deadly incident in January when a Metro train stopped inside a tunnel, and passengers were trapped as the train filled with smoke.

Meadows said he, along with Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., also discussed budget autonomy for the District of Columbia with the mayor. Though Meadows said the issue has ""not been on my top ten list of things to deal with,"" he expressed a desire to ensure that the city functions in cases where the federal appropriations process stalls.

""I shared with her that it's certainly our desire to make sure that school kids get to go to school regardless of what happens in the federal issues here,"" Meadows said.

Meadows also said they briefly discussed the marijuana initiative, and while they did not resolve any differences, the conversations would continue.

""I think that the real difficult thing, with regards to that issue, is you have a mayor who wants to represent the will of the people that elected her. And yet you have a sense of Congress that is contrary to that,"" Meadows said. ""And where does that leave us? And so, again, we're going to have to have a number of follow-up conversations.""

Correction, 11 a.m. Friday

A previous version of this story stated that Bowser met Thursday with Rep. Steny H. Hoyer. That meeting was actually rescheduled."
949576,This Proposed Law Would Ban Federal Employees from Watching Porn on the Job,8,"By Daniel Bean

Maybe this could finally help get congress to work.

A new piece of legislation introduced in the House Wednesday looks to officially outlaw federal employees from viewing pornographic materials while on the job.

There is currently no nation-wide regulation definitively prohibiting NSFW behavior by employees of the state. That fact was brought to popular attention last May when an Environmental Protection Agency worker was accused of downloading over 7,000 pornographic files on his government-issued computer. The agency said the employee spent as much as six hours of his work day viewing these files.

The author of the new Eliminating Pornography From Agencies Act, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., points out in a blog post about the prospective law that the unnamed EPA employee has yet to be fired, and that other similar reports of porn-surfing federal employees have popped up since.

Though the new law, if passed, would obviously not result in any international mandate, the problem it looks to tackle is not just exclusive to the U.S. Three Indian politicians were forced to resign in 2012 after they were caught viewing pornography on a smartphone during a session of parliament.

And a 2013 report indicates that, in a year's time, there were over 300,000 attempts to reach pornographic websites on the networks that service the British Parliament. Randy

The bill introduced in the U.S. Congress Wednesday is the second Meadows has authored with the same name. Govtrack.us gives his latest attempt a ""2%"" chance of being enacted.

Unfortunately for Meadows, it's pretty difficult to get a law passed by congress when all of its members are so busy withcomputer work."

Republican Congressman Mark Meadows (NC) has introduced his Eliminating Pornography from Agencies Act this week, which would make it very naughty, and prevent government employees from having access to porn or other ""explicit material"" while they are working on ""government computers and devices.""

Meadows mentioned in a press release the incident where an EPA employee was caught viewing a daily 6 hour dose of pornography, as well as downloading thousands of ""pornographic files on to government computer.""

Last year, an Inspector General report revealed that one Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employee, who still has his job, was viewing as much as 6 hours of pornography a day in his office on his government computer.

The same federal employee was found to have downloaded as many as 7,000 pornographic files onto his government computer. To date, this employee has yet to be fired and we continue to learn of similar bad actors.

""While there are rules in place at most agencies to ban this kind of unprofessional and potentially hostile workplace behavior, it continues to take place. There is absolutely no excuse for federal employees to be viewing and downloading pornographic materials on the taxpayers' dime""Further, downloading these files, which are often ridden with viruses and malware, poses a cybersecurity threat at our federal agencies. This commonsense legislation ensures that federal workers have a comfortable, safe work environment and protects taxpayer resources from being misused.""-Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC)

949580,The Hill - House GOP presses IRS on ObamaCare,8,"By Bernie Becker

The new House Oversight chairman is pushing the IRS for details over how it's implementing the agency's role in ObamaCare -- and what it will do if the Supreme Court rules against the administration in a new healthcare case.

Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), joined by Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), told the IRS on Thursday he wants to know what the agency is doing to help taxpayers understand new requirements from the Affordable Care Act. 

Taxpayers have to reconcile the amount of credit they received to help purchase healthcare on their tax returns this year with their income amount. Plus, roughly six million people might have to pay a penalty for not having insurance. Those new requirements are coming at a time when Congress has slashed the agency's budget, and IRS officials are warning that services for taxpayers will be reduced this year.

""Tax professionals have noted the new forms are complicated, and many taxpayers are wholly unfamiliar with the new requirements,"" the three Republicans wrote to John Koskinen, the IRS commissioner.

""In fact, it appears the biggest beneficiaries of the ACA's changes to our tax system may be private tax preparation companies,"" they added.

The Republicans also said they were concerned that the IRS won't know how to respond if the Supreme Court rules that subsidies for insurance can't be issued through the federal exchange. 

Because of that, the Oversight panel asked the IRS for a wide range of information: documents from the start of 2014 dealing with messaging on taxpayer services, ACA-related forms, the tax credit for insurance and contingency plans for the Supreme Court's ruling in King v. Burwell."
949581,"The Washington Post - Is Rep. Mark Meadows, New Chair of Government-ops Panel, Open to Federal Workers?",8,"By Joe Davidson

Mark Meadows is a difficult man to predict.

As the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on government operations, the North Carolina Republican is in a key position to affect federal workplace and employee issues.

But what should they expect from him?

While his right-wing credentials shine, he appears more open to the concerns of federal government workers than his terrible federal union ratings would indicate. He plans to meet with employees in a different agency each month.

Yet in a political party that trumpets its conservative positions, Meadows tries to push it further from the center. Witness his vote against the reelection of Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) as speaker. Meadows is also a founder of the newly organized House Freedom Caucus, which apparently feels that House Republicans need to be reminded of conservative principles. The Freedom Caucus, he said, will ""provide a unified conservative voice in the House Republican Conference.&#8201;.&#8201;. to make the concerns of conservatives known.""

Meadows has flirted with ""birthers,"" who gag on the notion that President Obama is a natural-born American, although the congressman doesn't doubt the president's citizenship. He was among the Republicans blamed for instigating the 2013 government shutdown, but he says he never wanted it and sees no benefits that came from it.

In a committee with a reputation for caustic partisanship, Meadows and Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (Va.), a progressive and the top Democrat on the subcommittee, speak warmly of their personal and professional relationship.

""Mark and I like each other a lot, and the chemistry between us is very positive,"" said Connolly, adding that both are ""committed to making government more effective and to a fair approach to federal employees."" Despite his strong conservative position, Meadows ""is someone who is capable of seeing beyond partisan politics,"" Connolly said.

There will be a number of opportunities to find out whether Connolly is right."
949585,"carolinapublicpress.org - After Tuesday's SOTU, WNC Republicans Issue Critiques",8,"By  James Harrison 

Despite new-found control in both chambers of the U.S. Congress, Republican lawmakers representing North Carolina spent more time in their seats than their Democratic colleagues Tuesday evening, at President Barack Obama's State of the Union Address.

The speech, Obama's sixth as president, found him declaring a page turned after years of war and recession and championing policies geared at the middle class -- including reforms to the nation's tax code and a proposal for free community college.

Coming in at just under an hour, the president challenged Republican House and Senate members to ""recapture a sense of common purpose"" and pursue policies rooted in American values.

House members representing the 18 westernmost counties of North Carolina -- Rep. Patrick McHenry, Rep. Mark Meadows and Rep. Virginia Foxx -- did not give the address favorable reviews.

""Tonight, President Obama had the opportunity to lay out a bipartisan agenda, aimed at achieving consensus with congressional Republicans during his final two years in office,"" McHenry said in a news release issued immediately following the speech. ""Unfortunately what I heard was more of the same big government polices which have not worked and were repudiated at the ballot box by the American people last November.""

McHenry, who was named vice chair of the House Financial Services Committee earlier this month and represents North Carolina's 10th Congressional District, also criticized policies embraced by the president, including the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, arguing it had ""driven up borrowing costs"" for small businesses.

Despite belonging to the party opposing the president, McHenry offered his only guest invitation to Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, a Democrat. Manheimer told the Asheville Citizen-Times that the congressman offered the seat to her as someone whom he thought would be able to ""appreciate the message.""

McHenry's take on the speech was similar to that of his colleague, Rep. Mark Meadows. Meadows, who represents the state's 11th Congressional District, took issue with the president's rhetoric.

""While many of [Obama's] policy proposals seem well-intentioned, they miss the mark when it comes to growing the economy and getting Americans back to work, which should be the top priorities of both the president and Congress,"" Meadows said in a news release. ""Tonight, President Obama proposed what amounts to $320 billion in new taxes on Americans over the next 10 years.""

To back his claim, Meadows cited an article published by Americans for Tax Reform, the organization renowned for its no new tax pledge and headed by lobbyist Grover Norquist.

Rep. Virginia Foxx, who represents a portion of Western North Carolina in the state's 5th Congressional District, slammed the president's speech, declaring him ""mired in the past.""

""The American people spoke loud and clear in November, but it's evident from tonight's State of the Union that President Obama wasn't listening,"" Foxx said in a news release. ""Despite a rejection of his policies at the ballot box, the president continues to propose outdated, Washington-centered ideas that simply don't work.""

Foxx, who was elected to a sixth term last year, decried the president's proposals on tax reform and higher education, calling the latter a ""top-down federal government boondoggle.""

Still, the congresswoman thought highly enough of Obama to ask for what appeared to be an autograph on the floor following his address, causing a buzz among social media users who spotted her on TV.

Along with criticism, Meadows and McHenry also offered brief comments on areas where they saw potential for the Democratic president to cooperate with the Republican majority in Congress.

""There were areas where I believe congressional Republicans can work together with Mr. Obama, especially as it relates to cybersecurity and trade policy,"" McHenry said.

""The president can work with the new Congress to implement policies including tax reform, regulatory reform and investment in our infrastructure that will help grow our economy,"" Meadows added. ""I will continue to prioritize support for pro-growth policies that tangibly help my constituents and boost our economy.""

Republican Senators from North Carolina echoed their House colleagues in their negative reviews of the president's address.

In a news release, Sen. Richard Burr rebuked the president's threats of vetoing legislation passed by the GOP-led chambers.

""It is clear that the president is once again proposing to raise taxes for new Washington programs--doubling down on the failed policy of more taxes, more debt, and more spending and expanding the size and scope of the federal government,"" he said. ""The president has missed his opportunity to move forward with this Congress.""

The state's newest senator, Sen. Thom Tillis, said the president was correct in diagnosing the country's problems, but came up short in prescribing the most beneficial solutions for results. The senator called on his new colleagues to strive for a bipartisan approach.

""It will require a genuine willingness to cooperate, to find common ground, and to produce results,"" Tillis said in a news release after the speech. ""I will work in the United States Senate to find common ground, to find common-sense solutions and to end the partisan gridlock. Republican or Democrat, it doesn't matter whose idea it is, as long as it works for the American people."""
949591,Citizen Times - Lawmakers Pan Obama's State of the Union Proposals,8,"By Mark Barrett

President Barack Obama asked members of Congress in his State of the Union address Tuesday night to ""at least work with me where you do agree"" with the agenda he laid out.

Inititial reactions from the four lawmakers, all Republicans, who represent Western North Carolina in the House and Senate suggest that area could be mighty small.

Enhancing cybersecurity, trade legislation and infrastructure investments got support from some of the four, but their statements also showed broad disagreement with Obama's proposals to shift more of the tax burden onto the wealthy and make community college free.

Tenth District U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-Lincoln, said congressional Republicans can work with Obama on efforts to prevent cyber attacks and his desire for enhanced presidential power to negotiate foreign trade deals. Eleventh District U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-Jackson, said there could be cooperation on ""tax reform, regulatory reform and investment in our infrastructure.""

But Meadows was critical of Obama's plans on taxes and the president said nothing about easing regulations.

New U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said Obama was ""right to acknowledge that America's economy must improve and Washington needs to do more to help hardworking taxpayers, but unfortunately he doesn't understand that Washington is the problem.""

Tillis was probably the most conciliatory of the four, saying government must work on simplifying the tax code, helping small business and other issues. He said he will work ""to find common ground, to find common-sense solutions, and to end the partisan gridlock. Republican or Democrat, it doesn't matter whose idea it is, as long as it works for the American people.""

U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., was the most dismissive. After noting that Obama has threatened to veto some legislation before the speech, Burr said, ""The president has missed his opportunity to move forward with this Congress"" despite the fact that the 114th Congress has existed for less than a month.

Lawmakers disagreed with Obama's sunnier assessment of the status of the war on terror and objected to expanding government's role in the economy.

""What I heard ... was more of the same big government policies which have not worked and were repudiated at the ballot box by the American people last November,"" McHenry said.

""It is clear that the president is once again proposing to raise taxes for new Washington programs -- doubling-down on the failed policy of more taxes, more debt, and more spending and expanding the size and scope of the federal government,"" Burr said.

Meadows said, ""While many of (Obama's) policy proposals seem well-intentioned, they miss the mark when it comes to growing the economy and getting Americans back to work.""

The politician in the room with constituents in WNC who liked Obama's speech the best was the only one who has no direct vote on them.

Mayor Esther Manheimer watched the State of the Union address from the House gallery at the invitation of McHenry. She was in Washington to attend the U.S. Conference of Mayors winter meeting.

""In addition to the thrilling experience of enjoying the sights and sounds in person, and witnessing a moment of our nation's history, I was moved by the relevancy of the president's message,"" she said in an email. ""Focusing on the upward mobility of the middle class through jobs, education, childcare, healthcare and cutting taxes is a shared focus of Asheville's citizens."""
949595,Carolinapublicpress.org - WNC's US House Reps Vote to Roll Back Immigration Order,8,"By James Harrison

Less than two months after President Barack Obama unveiled an executive order aimed at protecting millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation, U.S. House Republicans passed a bill to roll the action back.


U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) represents the 11th District

Western North Carolina Reps. Mark Meadows, Patrick McHenry and Virginia Foxx all cast votes supporting the rollback. The measure also attached amendments for repealing the president's executive actions to a bill for funding the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The bill faces little hope of gaining the 60 votes needed for approval in the GOP-controlled Senate, and it has already been met with the threat of a veto if it were to reach Obama's desk.

Still, the measure's passage sets the stage for another Washington showdown, with the clock ticking toward a Feb. 27 deadline when funding for Homeland Security runs dry if no deal is met.

The threat of potential shutdown also comes as the department continues to address recent terror threats, including a foiled plot of an attack on the U.S. Capitol.


U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) represents the 10th District.

Following the roll call, Meadows, McHenry and Foxx all issued statements defending their votes, and they added criticism of the president's willingness to grant ""amnesty"" to undocumented immigrants by exercising ""unprecedented overreach.""

""Aside from being blatantly unconstitutional, this executive action is a slap in the face to the millions of undocumented immigrants who waited their turn and took the legal avenue to enter the United States,"" Meadows said, in a message posted to constituents on his Facebook page.

""It is clear our immigration system needs drastic reforms beginning with real border security,"" McHenry said in a news release. ""These reforms can be accomplished through bipartisan negotiations, not unilateral executive decree.""


U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) represents the 5th District, which includes Boone and Watauga County

""Breaking the law to enter the United States should not be rewarded, but that's exactly what President Obama did when he announced plans to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens through executive actions,"" Foxx said in a news release. ""This legislation will put a stop to the president's unlawful, unilateral actions, which are a blatant overreach of his Constitutionally-granted executive authority.""

Fresh off midterm elections and less than two weeks after convening for the 114th Congress, the potential for backlash against members for their stances on the issue in their home districts appears minimal. Kenneth Fernandez, assistant professor of political science and policy studies at Elon University, said the relative safety of Meadows, McHenry and Foxx's districts, combined with a small population of Latino voters statewide, offered the members few reasons to worry.

""In North Carolina, Latino voters comprise a moderate percentage of the electorate, but it's not high,"" Fernandez said in an interview with Carolina Public Press. ""It's growing, but so far in North Carolina Republicans don't seem to have paid enormous consequences for stances on immigration.""

Latino voters in North Carolina

According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, there are 120,593 registered Hispanic voters across the state, making up just shy of 2 percent of the 6.6 million registered voters statewide. The number of registered Latinos has increased more than twelve-fold since 2004, according to research by the Pew Research Hispanic Trends Project.

During the presidential election a decade ago, 10,000 Latinos were registered to vote in North Carolina.

The growing of the Hispanic population across the state, which ranks 11th in the nation for Latinos, is largely comprised of younger voters, ages 18 to 29. Roughly 25 percent of the state's Latino eligible voters are naturalized U.S. citizens.

Along with repealing Obama's executive actions, the House bill included an amendment geared at ending the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has allowed, among other things, work permits to be issued to more than 600,000 immigrants who originally came to the U.S. illegally as children. A group of 26 Republicans defected from their party on the amendment, including Rep. Renee Ellmers, who represents North Carolina's 2nd Congressional District.

As the only Republican from North Carolina to vote ""no"" on the bill, Ellmers suggested the measure was ""overly broad in scope"" and could have long-term negative impact on jobs and families in the state, according to the (Raleigh) News & Observer.

Meadows, McHenry and Foxx offered sparse comment on their support for ending the deferred action program. Offices for all three members declined to respond to questions relayed by Carolina Public Press regarding the issue.

Fernandez said Meadows, McHenry and Foxx would not likely be forced to strongly defend their positions on the issue, save for the possibility of a primary challenger down the road.

""Many of these lawmakers are in pretty safe seats,"" Fernandez said. ""They will need to be able to justify their votes when answering to constituents, but most of them feel justified in their voting because they see Obama's approach as being the wrong one. That way they are able to switch the agenda to being about the president's bad policy, with the most general threat to them being the chance a pro-immigration conservative runs against them in the primary.""

The Senate is expected to begin work on the House bill in coming days."
949596,federaltimes.com - Brace Yourselves: Congress Preps Civil Service Reform,8,"By Andy Medici

Over the last few years federal employees have weathered attacks -- some successful -- on their pay, benefits and job protections. But as the new Congress kicks into gear, lawmakers want to take another crack at reforming the civil service.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he will look at reforming all aspects of the federal workforce, from hiring and firing authorities to pensions and pay.

""We have jurisdiction on the federal workforce and there is no doubt we are going to bring that up,"" Chaffetz. ""From soup to nuts: Everything from how we hire them on the back end to how we pay them out in the retirement system.""

You Tell Us: What civil service reforms would you like to see?

One of his top priorities: Giving agencies more flexibility to fire poor performers and bad actors.

""We have a very small subset of people who are doing horrendous things and taking advantage of the system. Management has got to be able to dismiss those people,"" he said.

A Republican-controlled Senate also means that legislation has a better chance of passing Congress, Chaffetz said, and he plans to push legislation addressing federal civil service issues through Congress.

He said he would like to work with unions and other groups to figure out common sense ways to reform civil service issues, and fix what he called an antiquated government management structure.


Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), says federal employees should be fairly compensated but held accountable. (Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images)
Federal employee pay is also outdated, Chaffetz said, because personnel costs and salaries are not in line with what it takes to hire good people.

""IT specialists need to make more than some of their grades allow them to make,"" Chaffetz said. Civil service reform proponents are finding allies in federal officials, who want greater flexibility to deal with their workforces and pay their employees.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the chairman of the subcommittee overseeing the federal workforce, said his focus will be on making sure federal employees are fairly compensated while being held accountable.

He said recent news accounts of some federal employees behaving badly have painted all employees unfairly.

""It is a Herculean job that we must embark on,"" Meadows said. ""How do we make sure that the people who do the best jobs get compensated the best and are treated fairly?""

The current system is unfair to hard-working and productive federal employees, Meadows said, and while agencies need to be given the tools to hold bad employees accountable, those who do good jobs need to be recognized as well.

""The ability to terminate fairly is something that we must address and it's something that the American people expect,"" Meadows said.

As Congress kicks into gear, Meadows believes the committee will be working on legislation for at least some parts of civil service reform.

""I would be very surprised if there were not a number of legislative initiatives and certainly, as a subcommittee chairman, I am prepared to be very proactive,"" Meadows said.

Outgoing Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has called for an end to the defined-benefit pension system and instead shift to a 401(k)-style retirement policy. He said Postal Service reform could also serve as a precursor to governmentwide civil service reform.

""I would encourage Congress to view the Postal Service as a test bed or laboratory of change that might be applied to the rest of the federal government,"" Donahoe said.


Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., sees a chance to enact 'substantive civil service reforms.' 
He said agencies need to be be able to control costs and plan for the future while getting the flexibility to experiment without rigid workforce rules and he said the Postal Service could be at the forefront of that change.

""In today's world, does it really make sense to offer the promise of a government pension to a 22-year-old who is just entering the workforce? And how reliable is that promise?"" Donahoe asked. ""I'd like to see the Congress encourage much more experimentation at the federal level. ""

Other lawmakers are hopeful for positive reform but are worried about legislation that could weaken the civil service or tear down vital protections and benefits.

Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said if Chaffetz and other Republicans on the committee embrace cooperation and compromise there is a ""real chance to enact substantive civil service reforms that enhance the hiring process and empower our civil servants to be rewarded for innovating and improving program delivery.""

But if Republicans on the committee follow a less cooperative path, there might instead be efforts to tear down civil service protections and instill a culture of fear in the federal workforce.

""If past performance is a leading indicator of future actions, I would be disappointed, though not shocked, if the majority resumed its efforts to scapegoat rank and file civil servants in the course of conducting partisan witch hunts designed to score political points at the expense of effective government,"" Connolly said.

There will also be a rush in Congress to expand govenrmentwide the Veteran Affairs Department's recently acquired authority to more quickly fire senior executives, Connolly said.

Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., said while Congress needs to boost recruitment and retention of a quality federal workforce, too many politicians use federal employees as a punching bag during budget season.

""I'm concerned that worker pay, benefits and protections could be at risk in this new Congress. That's why I'll continue to work on policies that ensure public service is a desirable career that allows folks to make a difference for America, while also holding them accountable for their work,"" Tester said."
949674,"Washington Examiner - New Push to Preserve Revolutionary, War of 1812 Battlefields",8,"By Paul Bedard

Few states have been Ground Zero for America's domestic wars as Virginia has been, something which grabbed the attention of Sen. Tim Kaine when he was governor of the Old Dominion, site of the first successful English colony.

As governor, the Democrat allocated more than $5 million for Civil War battlefield preservation. Now he has helped win congressional approval to expand that effort to Revolutionary War and War of 1812 sites, with the help of the Civil War Trust.

""Virginia is home to battlefields on which American soldiers gave their last full measure of devotion to bring about the nation we know today,"" Kaine told Secrets. ""Passage of this legislation helps preserve that land, allowing future generations to visit and reflect on our history.""

The legislation is considered the start of a broader preservation effort, led by the trust. ""By adding Revolutionary War and War of 1812 sites to program eligibility, we protect additional chapters of our nation's history and honor our forefathers who lost their lives on the battlefield,"" Kaine said.

But it's not just about keeping development away from hallowed ground, the goal of most preservation groups. Kaine said the effort can also drive tourism and deliver dollars to communities around the battlefields.

""While it would be worth passing this legislation on that basis alone, battlefield preservation also helps drive local economies in small towns and helps preserve the rural character of fast-growing communities in our Commonwealth,"" he added."
949730,WAMU - Warner and Kaine Become Key to Bipartisan Coalitions in the U.S. Senate,8,"By Matt Laslo

Virginia's two Democratic Senators are expected to hold a lot of sway as more moderate voices in the new Republican controlled Senate.

Republicans now control the Senate, but that doesn't mean they can go it alone. In the upper chamber you need 60 votes to do just about anything and there are only 54 Republicans.

That's already making Virginia's senators prime targets for Republicans looking to build bipartisan coalitions. Senator Mark Warner is already bucking many in his party by tossing his support behind the controversial Keystone XL pipeline that will ship Canadian tar sands through the U.S.

""Keystone, I think, has been overhyped by both sides. There are jobs, not very many permanent jobs. There are environmental consequences, but our own State Department has said since Canada's going ahead to using this oil, how it's shipped is less of an environmental question than some have portrayed,"" he says.

Senator Tim Kaine is also lining up with Republicans on a bill to make it easier to ship natural gas overseas. He says he's not worried about offending the liberal wing of his party.

""People here wanted me to run for the Senate. They knew what kind of governor I was. I was a governor who was reaching across the aisle and making things happen and working with two Republican houses when I was governor. There are going to be things where a Republican majority might want help where I just see it differently,"" he says.

Warner cautions that it's up to the Republican leaders who now control the gavels on Capitol Hill to set the tone going forward.

""If the Republicans have to start with a united caucus on every issue, it's still going to be a challenge for them to get to the 60 vote requirement. My hope is that a broader group of moderates of both parties and people who are more interested in getting things done than scoring political points can come together and I'm optimistic,"" he says.

Both Warner and Kaine sit on the budget committee and say keeping those indiscriminate budget cuts called sequestration from coming back next year remains a top priority."
949731,WVTF - Kaine and Warner For Ethics Reform,8,"By Kelsea Pieters

With former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell heading to prison for two years, two former Virginia governors are calling for ethics reform in Richmond. 

When McDonnell was charged with corruption for accepting gifts, like a head turning Rolex watch, many political watchers in Richmond figured he would escape punishment. That's because the state's ethics laws are some of the weakest in the nation, according to watchdog groups.

But federal laws ultimately snagged McDonnell and his wife, Maureen -- who accepted clothes from designers like Oscar de La Renta and Louis Vuitton. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who served as Virginia's seventieth governor, says the General Assembly needs to act when they return this week.

""With this sentencing being done right before the start of the session, I just think it underlines and puts an exclamation point after, ""you've got to do ethic reform.' And what I'm hearing from Governor McAuliffe and legislators of both parties is this will spur them to do ethics reform that's long overdue and I hope that that's the case.""

The commonwealth's 69th governor, Democratic Senator Mark Warner, agrees. While he says McDonnell's sentencing brings some closure, he says further action is needed.

""I still think the Virginia way has meaning. And unfortunately there've been a series of incidents that have tarnished that image but my hope is that meaningful ethics reform will move forward.""

One proposal being pushed would put a one hundred dollar cap on all gifts state officials are allowed to accept."
949732,The Hill - Senator 'Concerned' by Lack of War Authorization Draft,8,"By Kristina Wong

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Tuesday he is ""concerned"" that President Obama has not sent over a draft for a congressional authorization of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). 

""I remain concerned that the White House hasn't sent a draft, although I did see, you know, the president's been saying he's going to do that,"" Kaine told The Hill.

The senator said he hoped the president would address the issue in the State of the Union address Tuesday evening. 

""I'm very much expecting and hoping that he will address that tonight,"" Kaine said. 

Kaine has pushed since last fall for Congress to vote on an authorization for use of military force that would explicitly approve U.S. military actions against ISIS, as well as lay out parameters for those actions. 

He has proposed an authorization  bill last year that would expire in one year and ban the use of U.S. ground troops in combat against ISIS. 

Obama said Tuesday during a meeting with congressional leaders that he would begin preparing draft language for the force authorization."
949754,NC GOP gaining clout in DC,8,"The opening of the new Congress on Tuesday brings some key changes for North Carolina that could add a little clout for the state in the nation's capital.

Republicans will control both chambers of Congress, and most members of the North Carolina delegations will be part of the political majority. Both U.S. senators and 10 of 13 members of the House of Representatives are Republicans.

The GOP's Senate victories in November also mean that a North Carolinian will head a Senate committee for the first time in recent years. Sen. Richard Burr became the highest-ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee with the retirement of Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and will take over as chairman.

Sen.-elect Thom Tillis, who will take the oath of office at noon on Tuesday, will be a junior member of a body that respects seniority. Tillis has said he'll focus on jobs and working with fellow Republicans to try to get bills passed and sent to President Barack Obama's desk.

Influential freshman class

But Tillis is part of an important freshman class -- the group whose victories turned control over to their party. Membership in that group may give him more influence, said Andrew Taylor, a political science professor at North Carolina State University. Congress under Republican control also can be expected to exercise heightened oversight over the Democratic White House and to try to roll back some of Obama's initiatives. That could also enhance the influence of the state's senators, Taylor said.

Even so, Senate Republicans will need cooperation from at least six Democrats to reach the 60 votes needed for most action, and that might be difficult. Republicans have 54 members, while Democrats, including the independents who vote with them, have 46.

In the recent past, it's been difficult for Congress to agree to keep spending flowing to keep the government open, and it remains to be seen whether the new Congress will be able to settle on a budget and pass appropriations bills, said David Rohde, a political science professor at Duke. Since even basic tasks have been difficult, it's hard to see Congress doing a lot on immigration and health care, he said.

The state's House delegation shifts to one more Republican member with the retirement of Democratic Rep. Mike McIntyre and the election of David Rouzer in the 7th District. Newly elected Mark Walker is a Republican who fills the seat that was held for 30 years by Rep. Howard Coble, a Republican from Greensboro. And Alma Adams, a Democrat from Greensboro, was elected to the seat formerly held by Democrat Mel Watt, now the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Committee assignments

Triangle representatives also are moving into more substantial roles.

Rep. George Holding, a Raleigh Republican heading into his second term, moves to a spot on the large and influential House Ways and Means Committee. Its portfolio includes oversight on taxes, Social Security, Medicare, trade and welfare. Holding will no longer serve on the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees. Many Ways and Means members serve only on that panel since its reach is so broad.

""The Ways and Means Committee touches many aspects of our daily lives,"" Holding said by email on Monday. ""From simplifying our overly complex tax code to allowing Americans to keep more of their paycheck, families and businesses win when the federal government gets out of the way.""

Tax reform is one area where compromise might be likely between Congress and the White House. Holding said that ""everything will need to be on the table including closing loopholes and stopping fraud.""

Rouzer will serve as chair of the livestock and foreign agriculture subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee and he'll also serve on transportation and infrastructure, which has jurisdiction over the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees coastal dredging.

Rep. Renee Ellmers, a Republican from Dunn, will remain on the Energy and Commerce Committees. She is also the chairwoman of the Republican Women's Policy Committee, a caucus of the Republican female members of the House.

Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield of Wilson will become the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Rep. David Price, a Democrat from Chapel Hill, is the ranking Democrat of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security."
949780,"Washington Post - Senators Take Another Shot at Startup Act, Pitching Tax Tweaks and Immigration Reform",8,"By J.D Harrison

Sens. Jerry Moran and Mark Warner are nothing if not persistent.

On Friday, Moran (R-Kan.) and Warner (D-Va.) introduced the fourth version of their Startup Act -- a piece of legislation they have been lobbying for and tinkering with for more than four years, and one that, in its latest iteration, would tweak the nation's tax code, immigration laws and regulatory system in ways intended to help revive America's entrepreneurial economy.

""It's new businesses that are going to create new jobs, and there are certain policies that need to be in place for that to occur,"" Moran said in a joint interview with the two senators. ""We need entrepreneurs and start-ups, and they need this kind of legislation.""

Moran and Warner both pointed to research by the Kauffman Foundation, one of the country's leading entrepreneurship research organizations, that suggests new and young businesses have historically been responsible for a large share of new jobs created annually in the United States. However, the rate of start-up activity has recently fallen sharply, to the point where business deaths now outpace business births nationwide.

Hoping to reverse that trend, the senators proposed the original Startup Act in December of 2011. Startup Act 2.0, complete with a few tweaks, arrived the following year, and Startup Act 3.0 was pitched the year after that. At this point, the bill's authors have decided to stop counting, reverting to the original moniker, the Startup Act.

Like its predecessors, this latest version features a number of changes to the country's much maligned immigration system, including the creation of a new entrepreneur visa that would enable up to 75,000 non-citizens to start and attempt to grow a business in the U.S. Should the company meet certain investment and hiring benchmarks within the first three years, the entrepreneur can eventually apply for a permanent visa.

In addition, the Startup Act would create a new visa for up to 50,000 foreign-born students who graduate from a U.S. university with a degree in science, technology, engineering or math (collectively known as STEM) fields, and it would eliminate caps on the number of work visas that can be granted to individuals from each country.

It's those immigration-related provisions that Moran believes would be ""the most valuable,"" to entrepreneurs. However, they are also likely to be the most difficult to push through Congress and the White House, he said.

In part, that's because critics of proposal to add more STEM-related visas have warned that the change could flood the economy with foreign (and possibly lower-cost) labor, which could threaten to siphon away jobs from American workers. Supporters of the bill have shot back with evidence that the U.S. simply isn't churning out enough STEM workers on its own to keep pace with growing demand from U.S. employers.

Meanwhile, even among those who see eye-to-eye on these so-called ""high-skill"" immigration reforms, there remains a difference of opinion in Washington over how to proceed with an immigration system overhaul. Generally, Republicans have been open to a piecemeal approach, while some Democrats, including President Obama, have insisted on a more comprehensive, all-or-nothing legislative approach.

""My guess, and it's an educated guess, is that 80 percent of the Senate would support the provisions in this bill,"" Moran said. ""Just because we can't agree on everything doesn't mean we can't do something.""

While Warner still believes ""best way to tackle immigration is to take a comprehensive approach,"" he says the country must hurry up and revise the rules that prevent foreign-born students who obtain degrees from U.S. schools from working here after graduation.

""Jerry and I may not agree on all the other [immigration] pieces, but we do agree that some of our policies are kind of crazy, where some of the best and brightest come here to study and are then required to leave,"" he said.

Coupled with the immigration provisions, the latest Startup Act would make permanent a complete exemption on capital gain taxes on investments held for at least five years in qualifying small businesses (those with less than $50 million in assets), create a research-and-development tax credit worth up to $250,000 for companies less than five years old, and require federal officials to conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis on the likely effects on start-up companies when proposing new rules and regulations.

""In order for America to maintain its position as the most innovative and entrepreneurial nation, we must win the global battle for talent, increase access to capital for start-ups, and create pathways for fledgling start-ups to become iconic American businesses,"" Steve Case, founder of Revolution Ventures and a former member of Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, said in a statement. ""The Startup Act encourages that.""

The measure would also devote more federal funding to help American universities more quickly commercialize technology and inventions that spawn from on-campus research.

""It doesn't get a lot of attention, but I think that's one of the most valuable parts of the bill,"" Warner said.

The initial plan, Moran and Warner said, is to try once again to move the Startup Act through Congress as a complete package. However, both said they were willing to break off pieces and try to move them separately -- perhaps as part of a broader immigration package or a larger tax reform bill -- if the opportunity presents itself.

""This ought not be a Republican-Democrat fight or a Congress-President fight,"" Moran said. ""This has the potential to be one of those things where the concentric circles come right together around this legislation."""
949939,"Houston Chronicle - Cruz on NASA's New Rocket and Spacecraft: ""Absolutely I support them""",8,"By Eric Berger

U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, has been named chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on science and space, which has responsibility for NASA. He spoke on Wednesday with Chronicle science writer Eric Berger about his views on space exploration.

Q. Did you grow up interested in space?

A. Every young boy or girl was amazed by the potential of space. When John F. Kennedy laid down a marker in 1962 that man would go to the moon, it inspired a nation and a world. Texas has been at the heart of space exploration from the very beginning. Unfortunately in recent years this (Obama) administration has lost sight of the core mission of NASA. My priority as chairman of the subcommittee is to refocus NASA on its core priority of exploring space. We need to get back to the hard sciences, to manned space exploration and to the innovation that has been integral to the mission of NASA. We should not be allowing NASA to have its resources diverted to extraneous political agendas separate and apart from exploring space.

Q. For the last three years NASA has been building the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. Do you support the continuation of these programs?

A. SLS and Orion are critical to our medium- and long-term ability to explore space, whether it is the moon, Mars or beyond. Absolutely I support them. At the same time I am deeply concerned about our inability to reach low earth orbit right now. We are entirely dependent upon the Russian Soyuz system. It is unacceptable from the perspective of space interest and also from national security interests. I have repeatedly inquired of this administration about its contingency plans if the Russians shut off the Soyuz. The answers have been altogether insufficient. America should have the capacity to get to the ISS without the assistance of the Russians. Americans should have the capacity to launch a rescue mission to the station should that prove necessary without being dependent. America should have the capacity to launch our critical satellites without needing to acquire Russian RD-180s (rocket engines).

Q. Do you support the efforts by Boeing and SpaceX to develop American vehicles to get astronauts to the station by 2017?

A. I am encouraged by the progress of both commercial cargo and commercial crew. But we need a continued focus on the stated exploration objectives with maximum efficiency and expedition. One of the great benefits of space exploration, but also commercial crew and commercial cargo, has been the jobs and economic development that have flowed from allowing innovation and the private sector to play a critical role in space. Texas and the Houston area in particular has been a tremendous beneficiary of that private sector activity.

Q. Speaking of the private sector, SpaceX has a rocket testing facility in central Texas and is going to build a launch pad in South Texas. What do you think about the company?

A. I think it is terrific to see commercial companies innovating with regard to space. SpaceX has made substantial investments in Texas, and that is benefitting our state. I am an enthusiastic advocate of competition and allowing the private sector to innovate. Indeed one of the first priorities of the subcommittee will be to take up reauthorization of the Commercial Space Launch Act precisely to continue fostering an atmosphere of innovation and competition.

Q. Do you support NASA's mission to robotically capture an asteroid and then send astronauts to visit it near the moon?

A. The asteroid mission has at times seemed to have had a changing and shifting focus. It will be important for the subcommittee to hold hearings to help NASA articulate and formulate its priorities for space exploration, whether to an asteroid, the moon, Mars or beyond.

Q. Where does the kid inside you, that grew up fascinated by space, want to see humans go?

A. There's no limit to human imagination or to the desire for exploration. Everyone of us has looked up at the night sky and wondered what lies out there. America has always led the way in space exploration, and we need to reclaim that leadership."
949941,"Time - Sen. Ted Cruz: ""Our President Should Have Been There'",8,"By Ted Cruz

On Sunday, leaders representing Europe, Israel, Africa, Russia, and the Middle East linked arms and marched together down Place de la Concorde in Paris. But, sadly, no one from the White House was found among the more than 40 Presidents and Prime Ministers who walked the streets with hundreds of thousands of French citizens demonstrating their solidarity against radical Islamic terrorists.

The absence is symbolic of the lack of American leadership on the world stage, and it is dangerous. The attack on Paris, just like previous assaults on Israel and other allies, is an attack on our shared values. And, we are stronger when we stand together, as French President François Hollande said, for ""liberty, equality, and fraternity.""

Radical Islamic terrorists are targeting all of those who do not share their radical ideology, escalating their attacks in shocking ways.

In the last year alone, the world has become a much more dangerous place for Westerners, as terrorists have deliberately aimed their campaign of murder against those, most notably innocent civilians, who represent a free and open society.

We witnessed American, British, and Israeli aid workers and journalists savagely beheaded by ISIS in Syria.

We saw a sympathizing radical attack the Canadian parliament.

We saw Hamas terrorists butchering Israeli-American rabbis in their Jerusalem synagogue while they went about their morning prayers.

We saw New York policemen attacked by an axe-wielding terrorist.

We saw commuters in Sydney held captive for hours in a coffee shop by yet another radical Islamist.

And, now we have all watched, horrified, as a pair of al Qaeda terrorists attacked a satirical newspaper in Paris and executed 10 members of its staff and two of the policemen who came to their defense.

That same day, one of their co-conspirators shot a police woman and a jogger, then the next day attacked a kosher grocery store to terrorize Jewish patrons preparing for what they had hoped would be a peaceful Shabbat. By the time the siege was over, four more innocents were dead.

Aid workers, members of the media, government, cafés, law enforcement, Christians, Jews, and even other Muslims--these are the targets of radical Islamists. They want to destroy civil society.

Their grievances are not against any particular government or policy; they are offended by the very notion of a free society where individuals have the right to worship, vote, and express themselves as they please--rights that are defended by security forces whose job is not to persecute or coerce citizens, but to protect them.

Our freedoms are anathema to the radical Islamists, and they are willing to sacrifice their very lives to attack us with anything from meat cleavers to Kalashnikovs--anything to terrorize us into submitting to their brutal, totalitarian, warped version of Islam.

Our choice now is either to confront this intolerable threat to our liberty, or to continue to respond to the attacks as if they are isolated incidents that we might be able to prevent if we would only stop somehow ""provoking"" them.

If events in Paris teach us anything, it is the utter failure of the latter approach. It has not made things better. It has made them worse.

It is not Israel's fault, or the fault of the Jews of Paris or Jerusalem.

It is not the fault of journalists or aid workers trying to document or lend assistance to the cruel civil war in Syria. It is not the NYPD's fault.

It is not Charlie Hebdo's fault.

It is not the fault of the commuters of Sydney, nor the freely elected government of Canada, any more than it was the fault of the runners in the Boston Marathon or the soldiers of Fort Hood in my home state of Texas--or for that matter of the 3,000 people who died on that sunny September day in 2001.

It is not the fault of America.

The scourge of radical Islamic terrorism is the exclusive fault of those who launch the attacks.

We must, as Americans, demand that our nation summon the will to stand up and lead the effort.

Recently, the President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a Muslim, gave a remarkable speech at Al-Azhar University in Cairo in which he challenged peaceful Muslims to confront what is happening to their religion--to stand up those who would twist faith into a mandate to murder.

This is where we can find our strength--by coordinating closely with our allies who are fighting this common threat. We can reject attempts to draw a moral equivalence between our friends and those who support or condone the terrorists. Instead, we should condemn and shun state sponsors of terrorism. We should encourage Muslim nations like Egypt and Saudi Arabia to join us and aspire to freedom in their own societies.

And, we should make it clear to the radical Islamic terrorists that the United States is not going to simply ""move on"" from Paris in the hopes that they will leave us alone, but rather that we are going to call them out by name as we stand strong and lead the fight against them.

Many of our allies gathered together in Paris yesterday in an admirable display of determination. Our President should have been there, because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies. We should never hesitate to speak the truth. In Paris or anywhere else in the world."
950000,"National Journal - Ted Cruz Has to Deal With Jury Duty, Just Like the Rest of Us",8,"BY Rebecca Nelson 

In a show of civic responsibility, Sen. Ted Cruz did Friday what many Americans would do almost anything to avoid: He showed up for jury duty.

The Texas Republican was spotted Friday morning at Houston's Harris County Jury Plaza going through security, posing for photos and, somewhat controversially, wearing white socks. His peers in the selection process--those who recognized him--registered their surprise on Twitter and Instagram.

Although the Senate is in session (but not voting) Friday, Cruz, a former lawyer and Texas solicitor general, told Houston's ABC affiliate, KTRK, that he was ""happy to come down and do my civic duty.""

""I would certainly encourage everyone else when you get a jury summons to come down to participate,"" he said. ""It's like voting. It's part of the responsibilities of the citizen.""

Cruz said it was the first time he'd been summoned. Though he likely won't be selected, the process isn't over yet.

""It would be a bit of a complication if I ended up in a six-week trial,"" Cruz told reporters. ""That would be in some tension with getting back to Washington and doing my job representing Texans. But I think at the end of the day that'll work itself out.""

If that doesn't happen, Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett offered the senator and likely presidential contender a piece of advice to avoid selection: Act crazy."
950001,The Pueblo Chieftain - GOP Lawmakers: It's Obama's Job to Plan Fight Against ISIS,8,"By Peter Roper

Colorado's Republican lawmakers said it's President Barack Obama's job to lead the war against the Islamic State and kept their distance Wednesday from a White House request that Congress formally approve more military action there.

Obama is asking lawmakers for a three-year authorization to ramp up the use of U.S. special forces, air strikes and limited ground operations against ISIS.

Newly elected Sen. Cory Gardner said Obama was right to ask Congress for authority, but he pushed the ultimate responsibility for the fight back to the White House.

""Coloradans and Americans deserve to have the administration lay out a clear overall strategy to defeat ISIS,"" Gardner said in a statement.

""The president must provide the kind of leadership on the issue that only our commander-in-chief can, and make a clear, compelling case for his plan.""

Rep. Scott Tipton said Obama's call for a three-year effort -- authorizing special-operations troops, search and rescue missions, air strikes and short-term ground operations -- wasn't detailed enough.

""He's talking about air strikes and more local participation (from Arab allies) but we're not seeing a real plan,"" said Tipton, who represents Pueblo and the 3rd Congressional District.

Tipton -- like both Democrats and Republicans -- said he doesn't want to give Obama a ""blank check"" to simply ramp up the U.S. war effort.

But Tipton wouldn't say what action the U.S. should take against ISIS. Like Gardner, he said that's Obama's job.

""He's the commander-in-chief,"" Tipton said. ""We don't want 535 members of Congress trying to lay out the best plan of action.""

Tipton said Obama was wrong to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq but he didn't want to say if those Army brigades needed to be redeployed.

""I'm going to defer to the military,"" he said.

Rep. Ken Buck, who represents the 4th Congressional District, said he wanted to see ""clearly defined limits and goals"" in any authorization approved by Congress.

Lawmakers pointed to the recent death of hostage Kayla Mueller and other Americans held hostage by ISIS as proof the Islamic jihadist group is a danger to all Americans.

But that was mixed with calls that Congress limit White House authority.

""I won't give this president or any other a blank check to engage in unending and poorly defined wars,"" Buck said.

But even Democratic lawmakers said they wanted to hear more details of the Obama plan.

""Coloradans are rightfully concerned about sending our troops into another conflict,"" Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet said in his statement."
950002,New York Times - Ted Cruz Sends a Message That He's No Enemy of Science,8,"By David S. Joachim

Senator Ted Cruz wants everyone, especially his fellow Texans, to know that he supports NASA's contributions to science and discovery, and that they should not fear his appointment to lead the subcommittee that oversees the space agency.

""Texas has a major stake in space exploration,"" Mr. Cruz, a Republican, said in a statement on Wednesday, referring to the space center in Houston. ""Our space program marks the frontier of future technologies for defense, communications, transportation and more, and our mind-set should be focused on NASA's primary mission: exploring space and developing the wealth of new technologies that stem from its exploration.""

Mr. Cruz's critics, particularly on the left, have accused him of antagonism toward science, in part because he has expressed doubts about the science of climate change. Some of them have expressed concern that his new role on the Subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness will lead to budget cuts for NASA.

But Mr. Cruz's statement seemed intended to allay those fears.

""We must refocus our investment on the hard sciences, on getting men and women into space, on exploring low-Earth orbit and beyond, and not on political distractions that are extraneous to NASA's mandate,"" he said. ""I am excited to raise these issues in our subcommittee and look forward to producing legislation that confirms our shared commitment to this vital mission."""
950007,"Washington Post - Ted Cruz to Senate Republicans: We Must ""Earn the Mandate we Were Given'",8,"By Jose A. Delreal

GOP Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) warned his fellow Republicans Monday that the new Senate majority needs to ""earn the mandate we've been given"" and accused his colleagues on Capitol Hill -- including members of his own party -- of pandering to corporate interests.

""We need to demonstrate that we believe the words we said on the campaign trail,"" Cruz said during a policy summit Monday organized by Heritage Action. ""The biggest divide in America is not between Republicans and Democrats, it's between career politicians and the American people.""

Cruz told audience members that Republicans would have to embrace a ""big, bold, positive agenda"" that emphasizes economic growth and job creation for working Americans, rather than feeding a ""culture of corruption"" and representing corporate interests. The freshman Texas senator also called-out members of his party for passing a $1 trillion spending bill in December that he says was ""a giant pile of corporate welfare.""

""The election was not an embrace of Republicans. The election was not an embrace of one party. Instead the election, in my view, was the voters roundly repudiating the path we're on,"" he said.""Let's stand up and lead. Let's lead with a big, bold positive agenda that says to the American people, 'You had a referendum and you rejected the Obama agenda. There is a better way.' That's our opportunity.""

The tea party favorite struck a heavily populist tone while hitting the Obama administration on its economic policy.

""If you're a single mom trying to pay the bills and the cost of everything you're spending keeps going up and up and up and up, and the one thing that doesn't move is your paycheck every two weeks, you are feeling the consequence of Washington's easy money policies,"" he said.

While Cruz's remarks primarily focused on economic opportunity in the United States, he also spoke about various national security concerns and criticized the administration's fight against the Islamic State and its diplomatic policy toward Iran.

""You cannot win a war against radical Islamic terrorists with an administration that is unwilling to utter the words, ""radical Islamic terrorists. These were not a bunch of tick-tock Presbyterians"" said Cruz."
