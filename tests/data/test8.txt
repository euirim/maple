Following last week's referendum vote in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, Speaker Ryan has said that the special relationship between our two nations will endure. To demonstrate that commitment, the speaker is calling on the United States, in parallel with its negotiations with Europe, to pursue a free trade agreement with the UK, once it has formally separated from the EU. He made these comments in interviews Friday with Wisconsin media.
Speaking with Mike Gousha on WISN, the speaker said:
"Number one, we need to emphasize that they are our indispensable ally, we have a special relationship, and I think that does mean we should have a trade agreement with England -- with Great Britain. That is something we should begin discussions with Great Britain to ease concerns so that we do have a smooth trade relationship with Great Britain because they are our indispensable ally. And we need to show our solidarity. . . . Obviously it takes time to do something like this, but I think it is something we should be working on."
And later, on WBEL with Mike Daly, the speaker made the following call for a trade agreement:
"We would probably want to put together our own trade agreement with Great Britain, which would be easier to do actually. We're in talks with Europe on something we call TTIP, but I think we should do a parallel track of Great Britain--United Kingdom, excuse me--United Kingdom trade agreement while we talk with Europe about TTIP. It's very important that we maintain our very strong alliance with England. They are a special relationship--[a] very, very indispensable ally. Trade with England is very big between our two countries and very beneficial for our two countries, not like some of the other countries we've had problems with. . . you would not put England in that kind of category. . . . I think we should make sure that our trading relationship is stable, so that our respective economies are not affected but actually improved."
