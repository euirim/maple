Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I am pleased to have worked with Senator Cantwell and Senator Schumer to introduce the SANDy Act today which would provide much needed certainty and resiliency to our communications networks during times of natural disaster or emergency. 

Severe weather and emergencies can have devastating effects on communities, as New Jersey knows all too well. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, we experienced loss in our communications networks including phone and Internet services. Natural disasters are one of the most important times to maintain access to 9-1-1 in order to obtain lifesaving services. 

Just this week, this legislation passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support, including from the New Jersey delegation led by Congressman Pallone's efforts. I hope the Senate will now turn its attention to this important matter and move this initiative forward to the benefit of New Jerseyans and people across the country. 

I am further pleased that phone service providers entered into a voluntary agreement last month in order to provide service to consumers during times of emergency, regardless of the network the consumer subscribes to in that area. 

The SANDy Act expresses the Sense of Congress that this agreement should continue to be adhered to in order to best serve 9-1-1 professionals, first responders, and local governments in accessing communications services during times of emergency. 

Further, the legislation collects additional data on network security during times of disaster and the resiliency of telecommunications networks power utility during times of emergency. With additional information and data, we can better prepare for disasters and ensure our networks operate at the best of their ability when severe storms strike. 

Finally, the legislation provides authority to FEMA to reimburse costs associated with restoring and repairing critical communications services to first responders and communities. 

The SANDy Act is an important step toward better protecting and preserving vital communications networks when disaster strikes. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. ______
