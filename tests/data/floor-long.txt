Mr. BOOKER. I thank the Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, and the senior Senator from Connecticut as well. 

I do want to echo his spirit and the deference he gave to Senator Barbara Mikulski and Senator Shelby. Both of these two Senators are people I respect a tremendous amount. In fact, I would go beyond that for Senator Shelby and Senator Mikulski because I have deep affection for them. They are great, strong legislators, and they have produced legislation that is important to this country. I have a reverence for their work, the attention to detail, and the focus they have provided preparing legislation to move forward. 

I asked for indulgence from them to understand why I stand on the floor today preparing to ask a question to Senator Murphy. Last night, Senator Murphy and I talked about the tragedy of what happened in Florida. It was painful to both of us because we knew this was not in any way an anomaly. This was something happening with terrible, savage routine. In this Nation we are seeing mass killing after mass killing after mass killing after mass killing. 

We both understood, with other colleagues, that right now our Nation stands at a point of vulnerability to those who seek to do us harm, those who seek to inflict terror, those who seek to inflict grievous bodily harm, those who seek to kill Americans, and they have the ability to exploit loopholes in order to have access to weapons. 

So I stand on the floor today in preparation to ask a question to Senator Murphy, wanting to say that the motivation for his presence on the floor right now is that we just cannot go on with business as usual in this body at a time where there is such continued, grievous threat and vulnerability to our country, where you see again and again mass shooting after mass shooting. 

There is a saying that the only thing necessary for evil to be triumphant is for good people to do nothing. I am grateful to Senator Murphy for his conviction in our conversations yesterday and into the night that we could not just go along with business as usual; that we have had enough; that we have to push this body to come to some consensus on that which the overwhelming majority of Americans, indeed, the overwhelming majority of gun owners in this country and, indeed, the overwhelming majority of NRA members in this country believe; that we should put commonsense safety measures in place to protect against terrorists obtaining firearms to inflict the kind of carnage we have seen too often in this country and in others. Please understand, while many people imagine that when terrorists act, they act with bombs, more and more across the globe and across the United States they are acting with assault weapons and firearms. 

We are here today to say: Enough. I have cleared my entire day. This will not be business as usual. I cleared my evening events so that I could stay on this floor and support Senator Murphy as he pushes this body to come to some consensus, in the way the country has already done, to find commonsense, practical ways we can protect this Nation from terrorism. 

The Constitution of this country begins with the understanding that the primary responsibility of this Nation is about the common defense. It says in our preamble that ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.'' Written there in plain English, the Constitution laid out the very form of government in which this body stands and put in clear English at the beginning that we are to focus on domestic tranquility, the common defense, the general welfare. So we cannot go on with business as usual in this body. We must stand because this violence in our country will continue unless we take measures, commonsense measures, to restrict these firearms from going to known or suspected terrorists. 

I believe this is a day that should not be business as usual. I believe this should be a day that this body comes together as it has before, to put forth commonsense safety measures to prevent terrorism. I want to paraphrase one of our great leaders, Martin Luther King, who said: What we will have to repent for in this day and age is not just the vitriolic words and violent actions of the bad people but the appalling silence and inaction of the good people. 

That is why I stand now to ask a question of the Senator. That is why I will stay on this floor with my colleague from Connecticut and support him in this effort to move this body into putting forth the commonsense steps we should take to prevent weapons from getting into the hands of our enemies, from getting into the hands of terrorists, from getting into the hands of people who seek to wreak the kind of carnage that our Nation tragically witnessed this past weekend. 

The Senator from Connecticut, my colleague and friend, went through the unforgettable lists of mass shootings--Newtown, 20 schoolchildren and 6 employees killed; Santa Monica, 5 Americans killed; Washington, DC, at the naval yard, 12 people killed; Fort Hood, 3 people killed; Isla Vista, CA, 6 people killed; Marysville, WA, 4 people killed in a high school cafeteria; Charleston, SC, 9 people at a church killed; Chattanooga, TN, at a military recruiting office, 4 marines and a naval petty officer killed; Roseburg, OR, 10 people killed at a local community college; Colorado Springs, CO, 3 people killed at a Planned Parenthood clinic; San Bernardino, CA, in an act of terrorism, 14 people killed; Orlando, this past weekend--this past Saturday night--49 innocent people murdered, killed. 

I rise to ask Senator Murphy a question because there is a question on the hearts and minds of the majority of the people of our Nation. They are asking the question: How long will this go on? They are asking the question: How can we be a nation so mighty and great, yet hold this distinction on the planet Earth where these kinds of mass killings go on at a rate, at a level nowhere else seen on the planet Earth? It is here in this country--founded upon the idea that we formed this government for our common defense, that we formed this government to ensure domestic tranquility, that we formed this government based on the idea that we can make for a safer, stronger, and more prosperous land--that question is being asked from coast to coast, from north to south. 

Senator Murphy and I talked yesterday about coming to the floor today and not letting business as usual happen. We talked with our other colleagues who will come to this floor today and who all have in their hearts that word: Enough. Enough. Enough. What we are seeking is not radical. What we are seeking is not something that is partisan. What we are seeking is common sense and is supported by the overwhelming majority of this Nation. In study after study, poll after poll, survey after survey of gun owners, of people who have weapons and who take to heart their Second Amendment rights--when you ask them ``What should we do? Do you support closing the terrorist loophole, creating practical, commonsense bars for people who are suspected of terrorism from buying a gun,'' 82 percent of gun owners say ``Yes, we should do that.'' They say: Enough.

Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I have a question, but I think I can have a preamble to my question to set the context of the question. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Mr. BOOKER. The question I would like to ask is, Given the fact that the overwhelming majority of Americans support commonsense gun legislation, given the fact that 82 percent of gun owners support closing the terrorist loophole, and given the fact that 75 percent of NRA members support closing the terrorist loophole, why does the Senator from Connecticut feel this body is not moving on commonsense legislation that will protect our Nation, that will defend us against terrorists, and that will prevent tragedies such as the one that happened in Orlando? 

I direct my question to the Senator from Connecticut. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Mr. BOOKER. Senator Murphy, I am grateful for your yielding for a question. I think I want to drill deeper down on that point because I am not sure if Americans understand that there is a lot of bipartisanship when it comes to CVE, countering violent extremism. I am very proud to serve on the Homeland Security Committee. I have worked with members on the other side of the aisle to do a lot of commonsense things to try to counter violent extremism here at home. Those involve efforts of coordination, as Senator Murphy was talking about, investing resources in trying to counter violent extremist efforts here at home. 

There is a tremendous bipartisan effort that has gone on in this country since 9/11 in trying to take down silos of information-- sharing, cooperating, coordinating, and investing resources in many ways to keep us safer as a nation. We should all be very proud of that. But it is clear--especially from what should be stunning to people who don't know this and from the information you read--that the very enemies we are talking about--terrorist organizations that now have become common knowledge in this country, because people know Al Qaeda, they know ISIS, and folks are focused on that--the very enemies we are fighting against are aware of the big loophole that exists in this Nation--that someone who is a suspected terrorist, who has a terrorist intent, who is even known by the FBI, can come to our Nation or can be a citizen of our Nation and go to a gun show and buy weapons. 

I want to clarify what I said. That was not an accident. This could be someone who is in our Nation as a citizen or it could be someone who has come to our Nation through the Visa Waiver Program and could still exploit this loophole of buying weapons without a background check. So we have actually enough sharing of information to go on that we actually can stop an individual from getting on a plane. 

Think about this. We can take an action to stop someone from flying, but we do not have the ability in this country right now to stop that known individual from getting in a car and driving down 95 from New Jersey and going to a gun show and buying weapons. 

The data show that the GAO has found that between February of 2004 and December of 2014 there were at least 2,033 cases where a known suspected terrorist tried to buy a firearm or even obtain it. We know there are that many people trying to do this and that we have the ability to stop those folks. So given the context of all the areas in which we are cooperating to stop terrorism and that there is this one black hole where now the information isn't being shared for actions to stop folks from getting these weapons that can do such carnage, isn't this a glaring gap in our overall security procedures, policies, and structures in our country? 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Mr. BOOKER. Again, I appreciate this point that I want to keep coming back to, which is that we are--and both Republicans and Democrats talk about--in a war with a determination to defeat our enemy. Yet our enemy has spoken very clearly about exploiting the loopholes that exist in a way for those who are seeking to do terror to buy weapons. In other words, as to someone who is suspected already by the FBI, suspected by the American Government to have designs on the kind of terroristic act that could take many Americans, as we saw this past weekend, we already know who that person is, and our enemy has basically advertised the fact that it doesn't matter. If they were already suspected by the FBI and had been interviewed by them last year or 5 years ago, they explicitly said: Don't worry about that because America--singling us out from European countries and others that are terrorist targets--in particular has this loophole we can exploit. Even though you have been suspected of terrorism and have been interviewed by the FBI, you can still find ways to easily obtain weapons by taking these measures, such as going to a gun show or ordering online. 

We just passed a Defense authorization bill that will allocate billions and billions of dollars for our national defense. I don't mean to be over the top about this issue, but if our past enemies and past wars have specifically showed us what our vulnerabilities are and that they are going to continue to exploit these vulnerabilities and literally have ISIS-inspired individuals who have been interviewed by the FBI carry out these horrific actions by using a loophole, as we saw this past weekend, doesn't it make common sense to close that loophole when we are at war with folks who are inspiring individuals to take so much human life? 

When we talk about closing the terrorist loophole, we need to be very articulate and make sure that it is done in a way that just has to do with those people. As it stands now, the NICS system can potentially check to see if a person is on one of those aggregated watch lists. I wish to ask the Senator from Connecticut: Doesn't it make sense to have universal background checks in this context? That is what I would really like to get at. If you have steps to stop terrorists from exploiting this loophole but it is not a universal stop, we are not solving this problem. We are not really arresting it in the way that we should.

Mr. BOOKER. Will the Senator yield for a question?

Mr. BOOKER. The Senator is not asserting he is still in his 20s, is he?

Mr. BOOKER. I thank the Senator. I just wanted to clarify that. 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Mr. BOOKER. I appreciate the Senator yielding for a question. I have a number of questions for Senator Murphy. 

I think you bring up a good point. We have now been at this for about 8\1/2\ hours, and we have seen colleague after colleague. We have worked now through the majority of the Democrats in this caucus who have stood up and asked Senator Murphy question after question. 

I want to start, before I even give a question, by giving my respect and gratitude to Senator Murphy. In Isaiah, it talks about those who wait on the Lord, running and not getting weary, walking and not being faint. I see the consistency of his efforts, which is not just manifest during this filibuster. He has been on his feet now for 8\1/2\ hours, and it is not just today. Senator Murphy, in his maiden speech here in the Senate, stood right there--I know this because at that time I was still mayor of the city of Newark--and gave, still to this day for me of all the Senate speeches I have heard, probably one of the most eloquent, moving, factual, compelling speeches on gun violence that I have heard. 

I am grateful today because just yesterday, in a caucus meeting that I think my colleagues who are here will agree got very heated, very emotional, in which he spoke with passion, as did other colleagues, he and I began talking about making sure that this was not business as usual and that we didn't go through the same routines in this body every single time there was a mass shooting. There are mass shootings with greater and greater routine. 

You have heard it from my colleagues. It is an insufficient response that our elected leaders should simply pray and share condolences. To paraphrase one of my heroes whose picture stands on my wall, Frederick Douglass said: I prayed for years for my freedom, but I was still a slave. It wasn't until I prayed with my hands and prayed with my feet that I found my salvation. Faith without works is dead. Prayer is not enough. 

I stand here first and foremost to express my gratitude to Senator Murphy. We talked during the day, we talked into the night, and we chose to be here. I am grateful for his senior Senator, who has been here for the entire duration. These two partners from Connecticut went through the unimaginable when they shared the grief of a community where child after child--20 children--were gunned down and murdered. These two men have been dedicated and determined--not yielding, not giving up, not surrendering to cynicism about government or this body but continuing to fight and to fight so that we would do something about this problem. 

This is the first question I have for Senator Murphy. There is this idea that is deep within the history of our Nation, that when there is injustice--and there is no greater injustice than the savage murder of our fellow citizens, the murder of innocents. I have seen you time and again--and today is a model of courage as well as a model of endurance--take on a Senate that was prepared to move on, a Senate that was prepared to go on with business after the greatest, largest mass killing in this Nation's history. We were going to go on with business as usual. In my conversations into the night last night with Senator Murphy, I saw his determination not to let the business as usual go on in this Senate. 

I have a number of questions for you. But the first one, Senator Murphy, is that there are a lot of people who are surrendering to cynicism about government, a lot of people who are showing frustration. But yet, you are still going on with this in a way that reflects those people who didn't give up on the idea of civil rights in the 1940s and the 1950s and kept pushing legislation--pushing legislation before the 1965 Voting Rights Act, before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, before the consciousness of the country caught up. But this must be frustrating to you. I have been here for 2\1/2\ years. You have been here longer. We came here tonight--today--for a reason. I say today because we are approaching the ninth hour. We are about a half-hour away from the ninth hour. Can you frame one more time why you are expending your energy doing this now, here, in the Senate, especially because I know that perhaps there are people talking about: Well, they don't have a shot; they don't have a chance. There are cynics, there are critics, and there are pundits probably saying they may not get a vote. The majority of Americans, the majority of gun owners, the majority of NRA members might agree with Senator Murphy, but the NRA has too much of a hold on the Senate. Why are you here right now doing this on this day? 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Mr. BOOKER. That is the first part of the framing that is very important--this determination that we will not do business as usual and that this fight will not stop. We will take this fight to the Senate floor, we will take this fight to legislators, and we will take this fight to neighborhoods and communities. It is not a physical fight. It is a fight, in my opinion, of love. It is a fight that says we can be a country that affirms people's right to own weapons. We heard from one of our closest friends in the Senate, Mr. Heinrich, who is an ardent gun owner. He is a hunter. As a vegan, I have seen some pictures of what he has shot and killed, and he takes great pride and joy in that. What we are talking about--and this gets me to the next area of questioning--is that it is not about hunters, it is not about people who want guns for self-defense, and it is not about people who want guns because they love the sport. Senator Bennet took me out skeet shooting when I was in Colorado. It is not about the folks who want guns for that. This is about something very narrow, and that is the question that I have, which is the second part of this framing. I have heard some people talk about this in partisan terms. The truth is that this may be a partisan issue in Washington-speak, but when I go back to New Jersey--I go to communities like the ones I grew up in, where a majority of the community is Republican, and communities like the one I live in, where the majority is Democrat--I hear the same thing from members of both parties. They say that there is a lack of understanding in this country. How can we be at a point where our country is at war with terrorists, with our enemy in places such as Iraq and Syria literally trying to egg on and radicalize young people, saying ``Go to America''? Al Qaeda and others are instructing them that this is the country to go to and buy guns because it is so easy to get access to guns, thanks to these massive loopholes. That is the point that brings us here. 

Senator Murphy and I probably share beliefs about gun safety that are not shared by the majority of gun owners, and there are things I heard brought up tonight, frankly, that, hey, I might like. People have talked about magazines and research on this issue. I heard a lot of subjects brought up, but what brought Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal to the floor for almost 9 hours now, with me standing here this entire time, is to say: Hey, we as Americans can agree that someone who is a suspected terrorist and under investigation and might be on a no-fly list--that person should not be able to buy not just a weapon or handgun but an assault rifle. When you look at this issue, it is not controversial with Americans. This is not controversial with Republicans. This is not controversial with NRA members because the overwhelming majority of them agree that we should not be a country where a person can't get on a plane in Newark, NJ, but they can drive to a private seller or a gun show or go on the Internet and buy a gun. 

The second of three questions I have is that this not a radical thing the Senators from Connecticut are asking for. Senator Murphy is not calling for something controversial. This is something that, at this point, is common sense and is agreed upon by over 70 percent of gun owners. I am not sure if there is an elected official in the Senate that has a 70-plus percent approval rating. Rarely do you see people agree that greatly. 

Could the Senator please explain why he is taking a stand on this issue right now and what it is that he thinks we should be able to achieve on this common ground for the common good? 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I said one more question, but I have two more questions. This is sort of a progression. My friend is here today because of a commitment Senator Murphy made in his maiden speech in the U.S. Senate--a consistent sense of belief that my friend will never give up until we have commonsense gun safety in America. After the grievous act that we saw in Florida, where 49 innocent people were slaughtered, Senator Murphy, Senator Blumenthal, countless Senators, and I--at least half of our caucus has come down here and said the same thing: Enough is enough. We can't let business as usual happen. 

No. 2, and the reason my friend stood up and has been holding the floor for 9\1/2\ hours, has been in order to say: Hey, the terrorist loophole should be closed. There is one more element to this progression--an indefatigable Senator with a noncontroversial element in terms of the terrorist loophole, but now there is this other piece, which is just common sense, and I want to take that one step and ask that my friend go a little deeper with it. That last step is this: If you just have the terrorist loophole closed but don't have universal background checks--in other words, if you close the terrorist loophole so that anybody who goes to a Federal firearm licensed dealer or goes to a NICS check, that stops that terrorist, but if you still have these Internet and private sales, that terrorist, who probably will not even go to that Federal arms licensee, will go to the back doors that are still wide open for people to get guns. So what the Senator from Connecticut is saying is that he is not giving up. No. 2, 70-plus percent of NRA members agree with me on what I am asking for. This last step, where the majority of gun owners in America agree, why is it important to also make sure that if we want to stop terrorists from doing what they did in Orlando--if we do nothing, it may happen again, God forbid. Why is this universal background check element the second thing my friend is standing up for today, along with his colleagues? 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Mr. BOOKER. So the last question--and I know the senior Senator from Connecticut would like to ask a question. But this is where I have to say it becomes deeply personal to me, because what you are talking about there is your persistent, unyielding fight for commonsense gun legislation from the second you walked into the U.S. Senate, to the noncontroversial idea that terrorists in America--people who are suspected terrorists--should not be allowed to buy assault weapons, period. And your comment that that affects a very small universe of people, that in order to make that ironclad--again, nothing is going to stop everybody, but this is doing something that will constrict access to terrorists--you have to do a universal background check, so you close the back door, as you said. 

Now, this is what gets personal to me even more so because it is more than all this. When you do that, you are not affecting sports people; you are not affecting Second Amendment right believers who believe that I need to have my right to bear arms; you are not affecting folks who are worried about self-defense and want to have a gun to defend themselves; who you are affecting when you do that is not just terrorists, but you actually have a collateral benefit when you tighten up the system that you then stop criminals of all categories from getting guns. 

We live in a nation where women are victims of violence at astonishing rates. You close down that system for terrorists, you are going to make it much harder for someone who seeks to engage in domestic violence with a firearm--you are going to shut down their access. You are going to shut down criminals from getting guns. 

This is really what I experienced as a U.S. mayor. I looked at all of my shootings and murders as too many in Newark when I was mayor. I could only find one case--one case--where a law-abiding citizen used a gun in violence. The problem we saw overwhelmingly in our city was that criminals who should have been stopped were using these loopholes to buy lots of weapons and engage in criminal activity. So much of the carnage in our communities is happening when criminals can easily get access to guns. 

You and I have had this conversation privately so many times. I have sat with you in Connecticut cities. We have seen the impact and the pain and the agony of murder after murder after murder after murder in our cities. And this commonsense terrorist loophole closure--would the Senator please explain how that will also constrict the ability for all criminals committing murders at rates not seen anywhere on the planet Earth, because someone who has restrictions on them for buying guns for domestic violence, stalking, threatening a woman, can go get a gun; somebody who is an ex-con for a violent crime can go get a gun. Why is this also important because of the collateral benefits that would come about from this commonsense constricting and closing of the terrorist loophole? 

(Mr. GARDNER assumed the Chair.) 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Mr. BOOKER. I thank Senator Murphy very much for what I think has been one of the more remarkable exhibitions of grit and toughness. Senator Murphy has not only been on his feet, not only has not left the floor to use facilities, but he has stood in the saddle and has been for this entire time--as our colleagues have flowed through this Chamber, he has been answering question after question after question after question on a topic that he is passionate about, on a topic about which he feels deeply and personally. I just want to thank him for his leadership because it has captured the attention of our Nation. 

This filibuster right here--I know a little bit about social media. This filibuster right here has been the focus trending on Twitter, the focus of Facebook. It has created media attention on a problem because in a sense the Senator is giving hope. His very intention of coming here has met the urgent need that the public has seen that this auspicious body, this greatest deliberative body on the planet Earth, this Senate, designed by the Constitution to deal with the biggest problems of our land--this body would not just go on with business as usual. What the Senator chose to do is to say: Enough. Stop. We are going to have a discussion about an issue that is not just on the minds of the American public but is grievously affecting the hearts and the spirit of our Nation. 

Tens of thousands of people since Sunday have been standing around our country in vigils, in solidarity, expressing their pain and expressing their sorrow but expressing the feelings they have that we should be better than to allow such grievous, terroristic, hateful acts to happen on our soil. While the American public has been stepping up, this body today had a different plan--to move on a piece of legislation, to barely acknowledge this. 

So before I want to really reframe this, I just want to say to the Senator, thank you for the courage that you have put forth to say: Enough is enough. No business as usual; we are going to stop, and we are going to push for two commonsense amendments that cannot end gun violence in America, cannot stop terrorist activity here and abroad, but they can take a step--a constructive step--toward beginning to choke the flow of commonality of these incidents on American soil. As has been said time and again, as has been said by a number of Senators today, what reason was our government organized in the first place? We heard Angus King--wearing the Constitution on his tie--talk to that preamble: common defense, domestic tranquility. 

So I want to frame this again. But the first frame, I just have to say--the Senator and I talked about it after caucus lunch yesterday, we talked about it during the day, and we talked about it last night. I say to the Senator, you are not talking about it today; you are doing it--no business as usual. For that, I am grateful. 

It is merited that we also thank the many people who are involved. When the Senate is open past midnight, hundreds of people have to be here as well--not just the people you see here on the floor. The pages are in their first days, and this is one of their seminal experiences. Not the folks who are working behind the dais there, not the great Republican colleagues who have had to man that chair, but there are security guards and subway operators and the people who are seating folks in the gallery. 

I want to say thank you, and I want to point out the fact that Chris has helped to pay for food for not only a lot of the folks here but including the Republican cloakroom. I appreciate you, Senator Murphy. 

Now I want to get to the framing of what this is about because there has been a lot talked about tonight, most of which I agree with, a lot discussed, a lot far afield, but you came here with a purpose around two issues that are common sense; one is that in the United States of America, if our investigatory authorities see people as threats, are investigating people because they are believed to be desirous of committing acts of terrorism on American soil--people who have already been banned, in some cases, from flying on airplanes--we should take a step, we should make it the law of this land that the person who is a suspected terrorist, that person who can't get on an airplane, that person also should not be able to buy an assault rifle. 

That is so commonsense that as you said earlier today, perhaps 4, 5 hours ago, many people in America are shocked when they realize that a terrorist loophole actually exists. What you are fighting for, Senator Murphy, is not radical. It is not out of the box. It is common sense. 

What is even more important is that in this day and age, when partisanship does cripple this body from time to time on big issues, this issue is actually not partisan. Study after study has shown, survey after survey, poll after poll says overwhelmingly Americans agree with this. In fact, over 80 percent of American gun owners say we need to close the terrorist loophole. In fact, over 70 percent of NRA members say we should close the terrorist loophole. 

What nation when they are at war--where your enemy is actually trying to incite terrorism in your country, when your enemy is explicitly saying exploit this loophole--would keep that loophole wide open, where it is easy for someone with terroristic aims to hurt, injure, destroy, and kill? But you took it one step further, and I was happy this morning to work on an amendment with you that says you can't just close a terrorist loophole and leave open, as you called it hours ago, a backdoor for those terrorists to use. That means if you do background checks, they need to be universal because if it is just the brick-and- mortar gun retailers, you go there and you are going to have to do a background check. 

By the way, those background checks stop people every single year, not just people who may be suspected of terrorism. Frankly, they stop criminals, but we now know that we are a nation of change, where the buyers of weapons have migrated from the brick-and-mortar stores now to another market, often online or gun shows. Unless we close those avenues for terrorists to use, they are going to use them--so very much common sense again. The second thing that you were saying today is that we need to close the terrorist loophole, and we need to make sure we are doing universal background checks. That is the reason we are here-- the grit of a Senator and the common sense of two amendments that are very critical. 

For a moment, I want to tell you what was perhaps the most touching time for me in this 13, 14 hours. I actually checked the rules, and you can't acknowledge people who are in the Gallery. They are not here now, so I am not acknowledging anybody who is here, but your wife and child showed up. When I heard you talk as a parent about the love of your child and how you did something that is so important for us as Americans--in fact, I think it is at the core of who we are that this is what our country calls us to do, which is to take courageous steps of empathy and say, when other people's children are dying, that is not their problem. It triggers empathy in me. I think of my own child. I think about my niece. I think about my nephew. I think about my family. 

There is a privilege in this country that is a dangerous type of privilege. It is the type of privilege that says if something is not happening to me personally, if a problem is not happening to me personally, then it is not a problem. It is not a problem if it is not happening to me personally. 

That is contrary to what we say about ourselves as a country. The spirit of this country has always been we are all in this together. We all do better when we all do better. If there is injustice in our midst affecting another family, another State, another neighborhood, then that is an injustice that is threatening the whole. 

Senator Murphy, this is one of your core values. It is expressed by great Americans. It was expressed by Martin Luther King in perhaps one of the greatest pieces of American literature, the ``Letter from a Birmingham Jail,'' this idea that if something is going on wrong in Connecticut, if a tragedy happens there, if children are murdered there, that is not Connecticut's problem, it is our problem. Dr. King said: 

Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment of destiny. 

So, to me, that is a core element of our Nation. It is what our Founders understood when they said we are in this together. The very Declaration of Independence ends with a nod toward that interdependence, toward that interwoven nature. It was said by our Founders on the Declaration of Independence, right at the end, that in order for this Nation to work, we must be there for each other. We must care about each other. We must invest ourselves in each other. If an injustice happens to my brother or my sister, it is affecting me. That Declaration of Independence ends with those words: ``We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred honor.'' 

Now we see these tragedies, and I don't want to believe that we are becoming numb to them. We see them as some distant reality and not as a personal attack because when you attack one American, you attack us all. When you have an avenue where you can make a difference to preserve and protect life and you do not claim it, to me, that is a sin. 

There is a great writer, great thinker, Nobel laureate, who once said to the effect that the opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference. The opposite of love is not just hate, it is inaction-- lack of caring, lack of compassion. 

What gets me upset about this issue is that we have commonsense tools that have been enumerated by wise colleagues of mine. We have legal scholars in our caucus who understand clearly that there is no absolute right when it comes to freedom of speech. As has been quoted many times, the majority opinion in the Heller case, there is no absolute right to bear arms. It has been said by multiple Senators, just closing the terrorist loophole doesn't infringe on the rights of any American to bear arms, of any American sportsmen, any American seeking self- defense. This is just saying that if you are someone who is believed to be a terrorist, you should not be able to purchase a gun. If you are somebody on that no-fly list, you should not be able to purchase a gun. Even with that, as you pointed out, there should be due process so that if you have to grieve that, there is a process for you to grieve being on that no-fly list. 

When I see the Senator's child come here to listen to her father, when I see parents--many of my colleagues have children. I hope that when we hear about a mass shooting, we don't just say I am praying for those families but begin to think that what is happening to my fellow American is a threat to me. It is happening to us all. We all are lesser as a result of it. We have to think to ourselves, ``How would it feel if I fail to act, to do what is right, to close a terrorist loophole?'' What if right now that person our enemy is working to radicalize, what if right now that person in our country whom our enemy is working to inspire, what about that person who right now is seeking to do harm to Americans, what happens if they exploit that loophole tomorrow, next month, next year? What happens if they exploit that loophole, and this time they go to a playground, a train station, a movie theater, a school, a church, and it happens to be your playground, your movie theater, your school, your church, your child? 

If you know there is something we can do to stop our enemy from getting arms and doing us harm--and we have seen now from San Bernardino to Orlando, FL, the terrorists are looking to do us harm-- and we can stop our enemy with a commonsense amendment that is believed and supported by the majority of Americans, the majority of Republicans, the majority of gun owners, the majority of NRA members, yet this body can't do that, then we are setting ourselves up for future acts of violence and terror that could have been prevented. What if it is our child or our family or our community or our neighborhood? 

There is one more step I have to mention, I say to Senator Murphy. There is one more step that is important to this because if you close the terrorist loophole and make sure those terrorists cannot exploit the backdoor, if you make sure those background checks are universal-- again agreed to by the majority of Americans, the majority of Republicans, the majority of gun owners, the majority of NRA members-- you are also going to benefit by creating a background check system that stops criminals from getting guns, that better undermines their ability to get their hands on weapons that they want to carry out violence in our neighborhoods, communities, and our cities. That is where it gets deeply personal to me. As the Senator has for his child, every American has for their kids. We have big dreams. This is a nation of dreams. We have something called the American dream, which is known across the globe. It is a bold dream. It is a humble dream that this is a nation where our children can grow up, have the best of opportunities. Our children can do better than us. It is the American dream. 

But the challenge I see with American reality, where we have such liberal access to weapons by people who are criminals, what that has resulted in--I have seen it myself--is so many children taken, killed, murdered, time and time again, every day, every hour. Time and time again, another dream destroyed, another dream devastated, another dream murdered. And those are not just my words. I have seen it across my State. I have seen it in our cities and on our street corners where shrines with candles and Teddy bears are set up, marking place after place and street after street where children have been murdered. I have stood on too many street corners looking down at bodies--13-year-olds, 14-year-olds, 16-year-olds murdered in our Nation with a regulatory that has not been seen in wars past. I have been to funerals with parents begging us to do something about the violence in our country. I have seen children who are living, yet live with trauma and stress because they hear gunshots in their neighborhoods. 

We have the power to stop this, and we can't assume that these problems are not ours. Langston Hughes said it so poetically: ``There is a dream in this land with its back against the wall, to save the dream for one, we must save the dream for all.'' How many children's dreams must be destroyed by gun violence before we do the commonsense things we agree on to begin to shrink those numbers? 

It is written in Genesis that when Joseph's brothers see him approaching, with murder in their eyes, they said, ``Here cometh the dreamer, let us slay him, and see what becomes of his dreams.'' We have lost so many, and so many have been slain, but the dream of America can't die. There are people who want to take it from us. They want to inject it with fear and hate. The dream of our country cannot die. 

There are rules and loopholes that allow madmen, terrorists, and criminals to get their hands on assault weapons. We cannot let the dream of our country die and be dashed and killed. We can do something about it, and it is unacceptable, when you have the power, to do nothing. 

We, those of us elected to this body, are the caretakers of that dream. We are the torch with the light, the hope, and the promise of this country that still attracts so many. Hundreds of millions of people in our Nation believe, as do so many people outside of our Nation, that we must make sure that we form a more perfect union, where we see that unfinished business, the work to be done, and answer the call of our citizens. 

I return to where I began. There have been literally thousands of Americans who have taken to the streets this past week. I saw them in New Jersey. I read about them in California and Florida. I see them in Washington, DC, here in our Nation's Capital. 

Today I am proud that my friend has decided that that dream was worth fighting for, that the call of our Nation had to be answered, that that dream demanded something more than business as usual. Senator Murphy has stood on this floor for 13-plus hours. 

I don't know how long it will take, but I know that closing the terrorist loopholes and closing the avenues for terrorists to go online or to gun shows is just doing what makes common sense to keep us safe. I know we will win this battle. It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. 

As the hour grows later and later and this filibuster drags on, I just wish to address one more item. Senator Murphy and I both know from the thousands of calls to his office that one of the problems we happen to have is that we allow our inability to undermine our determination to do something; that when you have a majority of people who believe in something, often the only thing that stops us from achieving it is not that we can't--it is not a matter of can we, it is this: Do we have the collective will? 

I know from scanning social media that there are thousands of people watching this right now. As Senator Murphy speaks to our colleagues and speaks to the Chair, my question is, Can my friend speak to those people tonight, many of whom were cynical about this body but found a little bit of hope by your action? Can my friend take a moment to speak to them about how we can keep fighting this fight and what they can do to press forward and how we can make the dream of our Nation stronger, mightier, and more just so that a week or a month from now, we are not gathered together and mourning our Nation about dreams that were dashed by violent terrorists? 

(Mr. DAINES assumed the Chair.) 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Mr. BOOKER. This is my final question. I ask the Senator one more time, will you yield for a question? 

BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT

Mr. BOOKER. I just want, again, to say thank you to you. We started this about 13 and a half or almost 14 hours ago with business as usual. We started almost 14 hours ago with no focus on these issues in this body. We started this 14 hours ago with something as obvious as closing the terrorist loophole not on the agenda of the Senate. 

This filibuster--your standing tall, your multiple colleagues standing with you, over 2 dozen representing States from East to West-- and this measure is standing here together. It now seems that we at least will have a vote on those two things, the closing of the terrorist loophole and the expanding of the terrorist block so that we have background checks that can block terrorists who seek to get weapons through secondary avenues. So that is a good step. It is not everything I would have hoped for out of this day. But it seems clear to me that we have some work to do in changing the hearts and minds of some of our colleagues so these measures that have failed in the past can pass now. 

For those of you who don't know the history of this body, a lot of the most prideful legislation of America--let's take the Civil Rights Act, for example--failed many, many, many times. But those who kept fighting and didn't give up or didn't give in to cynicism were able to break that measure on the floor. This has happened with many pieces of legislation, from the abolishing of slavery to a woman's right to vote. 

Sweet Honey in the Rock is a group that I love. They sing a song called Ella's Song, where they say: We who believe in freedom cannot rest. We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it is won. 

So my hope is that this filibuster, now going into its 14th hour, didn't just win a vote on these two amendments, didn't just stop business as usual, didn't just get a chance to have a final determination at least on these two amendments, but that it happened to do something else, Senator Murphy. My hope is that it helped to push back on cynicism. I think cynicism is a refuge for cowards, that cynical people basically throw up their hands and say nothing can change. Thank God people who are fighting for our freedoms in this country didn't give in to cynicism and stop fighting. Thank God that those who have reasons to be cynical about government didn't fall into that trap of cynicism, didn't take that refuge for cowards and kept fighting in this body for so much of the legislation that we take for granted, from workers' rights to the rights of immigrants. 

So my hope, Senator Murphy, if I can express it to you, is that not only will we fight to win the vote on these two amendments--one by Dianne Feinstein in closing the terrorist loophole and the other authored by you, me, and Senator Schumer to expand background checks-- but my hope is that this filibuster did not just get those four votes but will mobilize it and engage more people to reach out to their Senators. 

I really appreciate the fact that your office got 10,000 calls. I appreciate the fact that your effort has been trending on social media, but that is nothing calling you, who already support this, and not reaching out to Senators who are deliberating over whether to support this or not. 

We are all here because folks not only didn't take that refuge for cowards through cynicism, that toxic state that debilitates us from being agents of change, but we are also here not just because of people who shun cynicism but because of people who embrace love. Love--I use that word very purposefully--love of country, love of patriotism necessitates loving your country, men and women, and if you love your country, men and women, you don't just tolerate them. I think that is kind of a cynical aspiration for this country, that we will be a nation of tolerance, stomaching each other's right to be different. If we are a nation of love, love doesn't just stomach someone's right to be different. Love actually sees the truth of who we are. We each have value, worth, and merit. We need each other. We are interwoven in each other's destiny. And if there is injustice facing you, it affects me, and I have to work to correct that. 

I am here, Senator Blumenthal is here, Senator Murphy is here, and all of the people who are working here, we are here because of this conspiracy of love of folks who didn't just take care of themselves and their families, they got engaged in their country, in their communities, in their neighborhoods. They did it for others. They served, they volunteered, and they sacrificed. 

So we are on another inflection point in America's history, with the worst mass murder in our country's history. You cannot control always what happens to you, but you can control your response to it. Let our response to this hateful act be love. Let our response to this terroristic act seeking to scare us be courage. 

Let us in the days ahead act with love and courage, as demonstrated by our engagement with our political system--pressing, pushing, letting our representatives be heard from in this body that we want them to support commonsense initiatives, the closing of the terrorist loophole and expanding that with background checks that shut off the back door for terrorists to exploit to get assault weapons to do repeats of what we saw. With that kind of courage, with that kind of love, our enemies do not win. We do. With that kind of courage, that kind of love, we don't stumble, we don't stop, we don't hesitate, equivocate, or retreat; we advance this country toward its highest ideals that we will be a Nation with liberty and justice for all. We are all families. From inner city communities to suburban, from rural to urban, all communities should enjoy safety, security, strength, and prosperity. 

So with that, I ask the question, does Senator Murphy agree that we have not just achieved this first step of stopping business as usual, letting this body go on, but actually getting two measures that were not on this agenda until this action began? Does the Senator believe that is not enough, and with thousands of people watching, people on social media now, we need to get more engagement to begin, as the Senator said earlier, not to change the hearts and minds of all Americans--frankly most of America is with us--but to start focusing on the Senators that will be deliberating over the coming hours, maybe days, about these specific pieces of legislation?
